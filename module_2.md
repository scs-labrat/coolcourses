**1. Defining Cyber Threat Hunting: A Clear Definition and Scope**

*   **Explanation:** Cyber threat hunting is a *proactive* security activity that involves actively searching for threats that have evaded existing security controls.  It's not just about responding to alerts; it's about *actively seeking out* malicious activity that might otherwise go unnoticed. It is an iterative process.

*   **Key Characteristics:**

    *   **Proactive:** Initiated by the hunter, not by an alert.
    *   **Hypothesis-Driven:** Starts with a question or suspicion.
    *   **Iterative:** Refines the hunt based on findings.
    *   **Human-Led:** Relies on the skills and intuition of the hunter.
    *   **Data-Driven:** Leverages data from various sources.
*   **Scope:** Threat hunting can encompass various areas, including:
    *   **Network:** Analyzing network traffic for anomalies.
    *   **Endpoints:** Examining endpoint behavior for suspicious activity.
    *   **Logs:** Searching logs for indicators of compromise.
    *   **Cloud:** Investigating cloud infrastructure for security threats.
*   **Contrast with Incident Response:** Incident response is *reactive*. It's triggered by an alert or incident. Threat hunting is *proactive* and seeks to identify threats *before* they cause damage or trigger alerts.

**2. Core Principles of Threat Hunting**

*   **Explanation:**  Effective threat hunting requires understanding the threat landscape, both past, present, and potential future threats.

    *   **Understanding Historical Threats:**
        *   **Why:**  Knowing past attacks helps identify patterns and anticipate future attacks.
        *   **How:** Review historical security reports, incident reports, and threat intelligence.
        *   **Example:** If you know that a particular ransomware group targeted your industry last year, you can proactively hunt for their specific tactics and tools in your network.
    *   **Analyzing Current Threats:**
        *   **Why:** Staying up-to-date on current threats allows you to hunt for the latest malware, exploits, and attack techniques.
        *   **How:** Monitor threat intelligence feeds, security blogs, and vulnerability databases.
        *   **Example:** If a new zero-day vulnerability is announced, you can immediately hunt for exploitation attempts in your environment.
    *   **Predicting Potential Future Threats:**
        *   **Why:**  Anticipating future attacks allows you to prepare your defenses and proactively hunt for vulnerabilities.
        *   **How:**  Analyze trends in the threat landscape, conduct threat modeling, and monitor emerging technologies.
        *   **Example:** If you see a growing trend of attacks targeting cloud infrastructure, you can proactively hunt for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in your cloud environment.

**3. The Threat Hunting Loop: Plan, Hunt, Analyze, Report, Improve**

*   **Explanation:** The threat hunting loop is an iterative process that guides the threat hunting activity.
*   **Steps:**

    1.  **Plan:**
        *   **Define the scope:** What are you trying to find?
        *   **Formulate a hypothesis:** What do you suspect is happening?  (e.g., "A user's machine is beaconing to a known command-and-control server.")
        *   **Identify data sources:** Where will you look for evidence? (e.g., firewall logs, endpoint logs, network traffic).
        *   **Select tools:** What tools will you use to analyze the data? (e.g., Wireshark, Splunk, PowerShell).
    2.  **Hunt:**
        *   **Collect data:** Gather the relevant data from your chosen sources.
        *   **Analyze data:** Use your selected tools to analyze the data for evidence of your hypothesis.
    3.  **Analyze:**
        *   **Evaluate findings:** Did you find evidence to support your hypothesis?
        *   **Investigate further:** If you found something suspicious, investigate further to determine the impact and scope.
        *   **Refine your hypothesis:** Based on your findings, refine your hypothesis and continue hunting.
    4.  **Report:**
        *   **Document your findings:** Create a detailed report of your findings, including the evidence you found, the impact of the threat, and any actions taken.
        *   **Share your findings:** Share your findings with other security teams and stakeholders.
    5.  **Improve:**
        *   **Review your process:** What worked well? What could be improved?
        *   **Update your security controls:** Based on your findings, update your security controls to prevent future attacks.
        *   **Share lessons learned:** Share your lessons learned with other security teams and stakeholders.
*   **Example:**

    *   **Plan:** Hypothesis: "A new phishing campaign is targeting our users." Data sources: Email gateway logs, endpoint logs. Tools: Splunk, PowerShell.
    *   **Hunt:** Collect email gateway logs and endpoint logs. Analyze the logs for suspicious email attachments or links.
    *   **Analyze:** Found several users who clicked on a malicious link. The link downloaded a malware payload.
    *   **Report:** Documented the phishing campaign, the malware payload, and the affected users. Shared the findings with the incident response team.
    *   **Improve:** Updated email gateway filters to block the malicious links. Trained users on how to identify phishing emails.

**4. The Pyramid of Pain: Categorizing Indicators and Observables (IoCs) to Maximize Impact**

*   **Explanation:** The Pyramid of Pain, developed by David Bianco, is a framework for categorizing indicators of compromise (IoCs) based on how much effort it takes for an attacker to change them. The higher up the pyramid you go, the more difficult and costly it is for the attacker to adapt.  The goal is to focus on indicators that cause the most pain for the attacker.
*   **Levels (from bottom to top):**

    1.  **Hash Values:** (MD5, SHA1, SHA256)  Easiest for attackers to change.
    2.  **IP Addresses:** Relatively easy for attackers to change (using new servers, VPNs, etc.).
    3.  **Domain Names:**  More difficult than IP addresses, but still relatively easy to change (registering new domains).
    4.  **Network/Host Artifacts:**  (e.g., specific registry keys, file paths, user-agent strings)  Requires more effort to change.
    5.  **Tools:** (e.g., specific malware families, exploit kits)  Requires significant effort to change (developing new tools).
    6.  **TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures):**  The hardest for attackers to change. These are the *way* they operate. Changing TTPs requires a fundamental shift in their approach.
*   **Practical Application:**

    *   Focus your threat hunting efforts on the higher levels of the pyramid.
    *   If you find a malicious IP address, that's good, but it's relatively easy for the attacker to change.
    *   If you identify the TTPs used by an attacker, you can proactively hunt for other attacks that use the same TTPs.
*   **Example:**

    *   You identify a piece of malware using a specific user-agent string in its HTTP requests (Network/Host Artifact).  You can then proactively hunt for other systems in your network using the same user-agent string.
    *   You observe an attacker using PowerShell to download and execute malicious code (TTP). You can then proactively monitor PowerShell activity for similar patterns.

**5. Key Enablers for Successful Threat Hunting**

*   **Explanation:**  Effective threat hunting requires the right tools, data, and context.
    *   **Total Visibility: Access to Relevant Data Sources:**
        *   **Why:** You can't hunt for what you can't see.
        *   **Data Sources:**
            *   **Network Traffic:** (e.g., PCAP files, NetFlow data, Zeek logs)
            *   **Endpoint Logs:** (e.g., Windows Event Logs, Sysmon logs, Linux audit logs)
            *   **Security Logs:** (e.g., firewall logs, IDS/IPS logs, web server logs)
            *   **Cloud Logs:** (e.g., AWS CloudTrail logs, Azure Activity logs)
            *   **Application Logs:** (e.g., database logs, web application logs)
        *   **Tools:** SIEMs, EDRs, Network Monitoring Tools, Log Aggregators
    *   **Data Quality and Availability: Ensuring Reliable and Accessible Data:**
        *   **Why:** Garbage in, garbage out.  If your data is incomplete, inaccurate, or unavailable, your threat hunting efforts will be hampered.
        *   **Considerations:**
            *   **Data Retention:** How long are you retaining your data?
            *   **Data Integrity:** Is your data accurate and trustworthy?
            *   **Data Accessibility:** Can you easily access and query your data?
            *   **Data Normalization:** Is your data formatted consistently across different sources?
    *   **Situational Awareness: Understanding the Environment and Context:**
        *   **Why:**  You need to understand your environment to identify anomalies.
        *   **Considerations:**
            *   **Network Topology:** How is your network structured?
            *   **Asset Inventory:** What assets do you have in your environment?
            *   **User Behavior:** What is normal user behavior?
            *   **Application Behavior:** What is normal application behavior?
        *   **Tools:** Configuration Management Databases (CMDBs), Asset Management Systems, User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)

**6. Threat Intelligence: Leveraging Threat Intelligence Feeds**

*   **Explanation:** Threat intelligence is information about existing or emerging threats.  It can help you proactively hunt for threats in your environment.
*   **Types of Threat Intelligence:**

    *   **Open-Source Threat Intelligence (OSINT):** Freely available information from sources like security blogs, vulnerability databases, and threat intelligence feeds.
    *   **Commercial Threat Intelligence:** Paid subscriptions to threat intelligence feeds from security vendors.
    *   **Internal Threat Intelligence:** Information gathered from your own security incidents and threat hunting activities.
*   **Using Threat Intelligence for Threat Hunting:**

    *   **Identify Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):** Use threat intelligence to identify IoCs associated with specific threats.
    *   **Develop Threat Hunting Scenarios:** Use threat intelligence to develop threat hunting scenarios based on known attack techniques.
    *   **Prioritize Threat Hunting Efforts:** Use threat intelligence to prioritize your threat hunting efforts based on the severity and likelihood of different threats.
*   **Examples of Threat Intelligence Feeds:**

    *   **VirusTotal:** A free service that analyzes files and URLs for malware.
    *   **AlienVault OTX:** A community-driven threat intelligence platform.
    *   **MITRE ATT&CK:** A knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques. (Technically a framework, but invaluable for understanding TTPs from Threat Intel.)
    *   Commercial feeds from providers like CrowdStrike, FireEye, Recorded Future, etc.

**7. Introduction to Threat Modeling: Understanding Attack Vectors and Potential Targets**

*   **Explanation:** Threat modeling is a process of identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities in your environment. It helps you understand how an attacker might try to compromise your systems and data.
*   **Key Steps in Threat Modeling:**

    1.  **Identify Assets:** What are the most valuable assets in your environment? (e.g., customer data, financial data, intellectual property).
    2.  **Identify Threats:** What are the potential threats to those assets? (e.g., ransomware, data theft, denial of service).
    3.  **Identify Vulnerabilities:** What vulnerabilities could be exploited to carry out those threats? (e.g., unpatched software, weak passwords, misconfigurations).
    4.  **Analyze Attack Vectors:** How could an attacker exploit those vulnerabilities? (e.g., phishing emails, SQL injection, remote code execution).
    5.  **Prioritize Risks:** Which threats and vulnerabilities pose the greatest risk to your organization?
    6.  **Develop Mitigation Strategies:** What steps can you take to reduce the risk of those threats and vulnerabilities? (e.g., patching software, implementing strong passwords, hardening systems).
*   **Benefits of Threat Modeling:**

    *   Helps you understand your attack surface.
    *   Identifies potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
    *   Prioritizes security efforts based on risk.
    *   Improves your overall security posture.
