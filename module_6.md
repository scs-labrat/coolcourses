Okay, let's dive deep into Module 6: Data Analysis Techniques for Threat Hunting. We'll cover each subtopic with detailed explanations, practical examples, and code snippets.

**Module 6: Data Analysis Techniques for Threat Hunting**

**Module Objective:** Master essential data analysis techniques for identifying and understanding threats.

**Introduction:**

Data analysis is the backbone of effective threat hunting. It's about sifting through massive amounts of data to find subtle anomalies that indicate malicious activity. This module will provide you with the tools and techniques to do just that. We'll focus on practical application using common tools and methodologies.  Think of it as learning to "speak data" so you can understand what your logs and network traffic are *really* telling you.

**Subtopic 1: Basic Search and Filtering**

*   **Concept:** The foundation of any analysis is the ability to quickly find relevant data.  Knowing how to efficiently search and filter allows you to narrow down your focus and avoid being overwhelmed by noise.

*   **Explanation:** This involves using search operators (AND, OR, NOT), wildcards, and filters to isolate specific events or patterns within your data.  The specific syntax will vary depending on the tool you're using.

*   **Examples:**

    *   **Linux (Command Line - `grep`):**

        ```bash
        # Find all lines in auth.log containing "failed password"
        grep "failed password" /var/log/auth.log

        # Find all lines containing "failed password" from a specific IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
        grep "failed password" /var/log/auth.log | grep "192.168.1.100"

        # Find all lines containing "failed password" but NOT containing "invalid user"
        grep "failed password" /var/log/auth.log | grep -v "invalid user" # -v inverts the match
        ```

    *   **Windows (PowerShell - `Select-String`):**

        ```powershell
        # Find all lines in the System event log containing "error"
        Get-WinEvent -LogName System | Where-Object {$_.Message -like "*error*"}

        # Find all lines in the System event log containing "error" from a specific source (e.g., "Application Error")
        Get-WinEvent -LogName System | Where-Object {$_.Message -like "*error*" -and $_.ProviderName -like "*Application Error*"}
        ```

    *   **Splunk (SPL):**

        ```splunk
        # Find all events in the "index=main" containing "failed password"
        index=main "failed password"

        # Find all events in the "index=main" containing "failed password" from a specific IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
        index=main "failed password" 192.168.1.100

        #Find all events in the "index=main" containing "failed password" but not "invalid user"
        index=main "failed password" NOT "invalid user"
        ```

    *   **Azure Sentinel (KQL):**

        ```kql
        // Find all events in the SecurityEvent table containing EventID 4625 (failed login)
        SecurityEvent
        | where EventID == 4625

        // Find all events in the SecurityEvent table containing EventID 4625 from a specific source IP (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
        SecurityEvent
        | where EventID == 4625 and IpAddress == "192.168.1.100"

        // Find all events in the SecurityEvent table containing EventID 4625 but not involving a specific user (e.g., "Administrator")
        SecurityEvent
        | where EventID == 4625 and AccountName != "Administrator"
        ```

*   **Key Takeaways:**
    *   Master your tool's specific syntax for search operators and filters.
    *   Use specific keywords and field names to narrow your search.
    *   Don't be afraid to chain multiple filters together to refine your results.

**Subtopic 2: Grouping and Counting**

*   **Concept:**  Grouping and counting allows you to identify patterns and trends by summarizing data.  Instead of looking at individual events, you look at aggregate data to find anomalies.

*   **Explanation:** This involves grouping data based on a specific field (e.g., IP address, user account, event type) and then counting the occurrences within each group.  This can reveal unusual activity that might be missed when looking at individual events.

*   **Examples:**

    *   **Linux (Command Line - `awk` and `sort`):**

        ```bash
        # Count the number of failed login attempts per IP address in auth.log
        awk '/Failed password/ {print $11}' /var/log/auth.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

        # Explanation:
        #   awk '/Failed password/ {print $11}' /var/log/auth.log:  Finds lines containing "Failed password" and prints the 11th field (typically the IP address).
        #   sort: Sorts the IP addresses.
        #   uniq -c: Counts the number of unique occurrences of each IP address.
        #   sort -nr: Sorts the results numerically in reverse order (highest count first).
        ```

    *   **Windows (PowerShell - `Group-Object`):**

        ```powershell
        # Count the number of events per EventID in the System event log
        Get-WinEvent -LogName System | Group-Object -Property ID | Sort-Object -Property Count -Descending
        ```

    *   **Splunk (SPL):**

        ```splunk
        # Count the number of events per source IP address
        index=main | stats count by src_ip

        # Count the number of failed login attempts per user
        index=main "failed password" | stats count by user
        ```

    *   **Azure Sentinel (KQL):**

        ```kql
        // Count the number of events per EventID in the SecurityEvent table
        SecurityEvent
        | summarize count() by EventID
        | order by count_ desc

        // Count the number of failed login attempts per account
        SigninLogs
        | where ResultType == "50057" // Failure code for invalid username
        | summarize count() by UserPrincipalName
        | order by count_ desc
        ```

*   **Key Takeaways:**
    *   Identify fields that are relevant for grouping (e.g., IP address, username, event ID).
    *   Use grouping and counting to find outliers and unusual patterns.
    *   Sort the results to easily identify the most frequent or least frequent occurrences.

**Subtopic 3: Link Analysis**

*   **Concept:**  Link analysis helps visualize relationships between different entities in your data.  This can reveal hidden connections and dependencies that are not immediately obvious.

*   **Explanation:** This involves creating a graph or network diagram where nodes represent entities (e.g., IP addresses, users, files) and edges represent relationships between them (e.g., connection, file access, process execution).

*   **Tools:**

    *   **Maltego:** A powerful commercial tool for link analysis.  It allows you to gather information from various sources and visualize relationships in a graph. (Requires a paid license for full functionality, but a community edition exists with limitations.)
    *   **Neo4j:** A graph database that can be used for storing and analyzing relationships between entities. (Requires some setup and knowledge of the Cypher query language.)
    *   **Open Source Alternatives:**  There are Python libraries like `NetworkX` that can be used for building and visualizing graphs, but they require more coding.

*   **Example (Conceptual - Maltego):**

    1.  **Start with a known IP address (e.g., a suspicious C&C server).**
    2.  **Use Maltego transforms to:**
        *   Find other IP addresses that have communicated with the initial IP.
        *   Identify domain names associated with the IP.
        *   Find email addresses or user accounts that have interacted with those domains.
    3.  **Visualize the relationships:** Maltego will create a graph showing the connections between these entities.  You might discover a cluster of infected hosts communicating with the same C&C server.

*   **Example (Conceptual - Neo4j):**

    1.  **Import your data into Neo4j:** This might involve parsing logs and creating nodes and relationships in the database.  For example:

        ```cypher
        // Create a node for an IP address
        CREATE (ip:IP {address: "192.168.1.100"})

        // Create a node for a user account
        CREATE (user:User {username: "john.doe"})

        // Create a relationship between the IP address and the user (e.g., the user logged in from that IP)
        CREATE (user)-[:LOGGED_IN_FROM]->(ip)
        ```

    2.  **Query the graph to find relationships:**

        ```cypher
        // Find all IP addresses that a specific user has logged in from
        MATCH (user:User {username: "john.doe"})-[:LOGGED_IN_FROM]->(ip:IP)
        RETURN ip.address
        ```

*   **Key Takeaways:**
    *   Link analysis is powerful for uncovering hidden relationships.
    *   Consider using tools like Maltego or Neo4j for more complex analysis.
    *   Start with a known entity (e.g., a suspicious IP) and explore its connections.

**Subtopic 4: Hunting and Query Languages (e.g., KQL in Azure Sentinel, SPL in Splunk)**

*   **Concept:** Learn to write efficient queries to search for specific patterns and anomalies within your data.

*   **Explanation:** Each SIEM or log management platform has its own query language.  Mastering these languages is crucial for effective threat hunting.  We'll focus on KQL (Azure Sentinel) and SPL (Splunk) as examples.

*   **Examples:**

    *   **Splunk (SPL):**

        ```splunk
        # Find all events where a user logged in from a different country than usual
        index=main eventtype=authentication
        | geoip src_ip field=src_ip
        | stats mode(country) as usual_country by user
        | where country != usual_country
        ```

        **Explanation:**

        *   `index=main eventtype=authentication`:  Searches for authentication events in the main index.
        *   `geoip src_ip field=src_ip`:  Adds geographic information based on the source IP address.
        *   `stats mode(country) as usual_country by user`:  Calculates the most frequent country for each user.
        *   `where country != usual_country`:  Filters for events where the current country is different from the user's usual country.

    *   **Azure Sentinel (KQL):**

        ```kql
        // Find all events where a user logged in from a different country than usual
        SigninLogs
        | evaluate bag_unpack(LocationDetails) // Unpack the LocationDetails column
        | summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by UserPrincipalName
        | extend Country = tostring(parse_json(tostring(LocationDetails)).countryOrRegion)
        | summarize make_set(Country) by UserPrincipalName
        | where arraylength(set_Country) > 1
        ```

        **Explanation:**

        *   `SigninLogs`:  Specifies the SigninLogs table.
        *   `evaluate bag_unpack(LocationDetails)`:  Unpacks the JSON in the `LocationDetails` column into individual columns.
        *   `summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by UserPrincipalName`:  Gets the most recent sign-in event for each user.
        *   `extend Country = tostring(parse_json(tostring(LocationDetails)).countryOrRegion)`: Extracts the country from the LocationDetails JSON.
        *   `summarize make_set(Country) by UserPrincipalName`:  Creates a set of countries for each user.
        *   `where arraylength(set_Country) > 1`:  Filters for users who have logged in from more than one country.

*   **Key Takeaways:**
    *   Learn the specific syntax and functions of your chosen query language.
    *   Break down complex queries into smaller, more manageable steps.
    *   Use functions like `geoip`, `stats`, `summarize`, and `where` to filter and aggregate data.

**Subtopic 5: Pattern Matching**

*   **Concept:** Using regular expressions (regex) to identify malicious patterns in your data.

*   **Explanation:** Regular expressions are a powerful way to search for complex patterns in text. They are essential for identifying things like malicious URLs, file paths, or command-line arguments.

*   **Examples:**

    *   **Linux (Command Line - `grep -E`):**

        ```bash
        # Find all URLs in a log file
        grep -E "https?://[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+.[a-zA-Z]{2,}/?" /var/log/apache2/access.log

        #Explanation:
        #   -E: Enables extended regular expressions
        #   https?://: Matches "http://" or "https://"
        #   [a-zA-Z0-9.-]+: Matches one or more alphanumeric characters, dots, or hyphens (the domain name)
        #   .[a-zA-Z]{2,}: Matches a dot followed by a top-level domain (e.g., .com, .org)
        #   /? :  Optionally matches a trailing slash.
        ```

    *   **Windows (PowerShell - `Select-String -Pattern`):**

        ```powershell
        # Find all email addresses in a text file
        Get-Content C:\data\emails.txt | Select-String -Pattern "\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b"
        ```

    *   **Splunk (SPL):**

        ```splunk
        # Find all events containing a suspicious file path (e.g., in the Temp directory)
        index=main | regex _raw="C:\\\\Users\\\\.*\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\.*\.exe"
        ```

    *   **Azure Sentinel (KQL):**

        ```kql
        // Find all events containing a suspicious file path (e.g., in the Temp directory)
        SecurityEvent
        | where CommandLine has regex "C:\\\\Users\\\\.*\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\.*\\.exe"
        ```

*   **Key Takeaways:**
    *   Learn the basics of regular expression syntax (characters, quantifiers, character classes).
    *   Use online regex testers to experiment and refine your patterns.
    *   Start with simple patterns and gradually increase complexity.
    *   Escape special characters properly in your regex.

**Subtopic 6: Timelines**

*   **Concept:** Creating a chronological sequence of events to understand the progression of an attack.

*   **Explanation:**  Timelines help you visualize the order in which events occurred, making it easier to identify the root cause of an incident and understand the attacker's actions.

*   **Tools:**

    *   **Timeline Explorer (Windows):** A free tool from Microsoft for visualizing event logs as timelines.
    *   **Plaso (log2timeline):** A powerful open-source tool for creating timelines from various data sources.
    *   **SIEM Dashboards:** Many SIEMs have built-in timeline visualization capabilities.

*   **Example (Conceptual - Using Timeline Explorer):**

    1.  **Load a Windows Event Log (.evtx file) into Timeline Explorer.**
    2.  **Filter the events to focus on specific Event IDs or keywords (e.g., Event ID 4624 - Successful Logon).**
    3.  **Sort the events by time.**
    4.  **Analyze the sequence of events:** Look for patterns or anomalies, such as:
        *   A series of failed login attempts followed by a successful login.
        *   A user account logging in from multiple locations in a short period of time.
        *   The execution of a suspicious process shortly after a successful login.

*   **Example (Conceptual - Using Plaso):**

    1.  **Run Plaso to create a timeline from multiple data sources (e.g., Windows Event Logs, web server logs, file system metadata):**

        ```bash
        log2timeline.py --storage-file timeline.plaso /path/to/data
        ```

    2.  **Analyze the timeline using psort.py:**

        ```bash
        psort.py -o l2tcsv -w output.csv timeline.plaso
        ```

    3.  **Open the output.csv file in a spreadsheet program and analyze the events by time.**

*   **Key Takeaways:**
    *   Timelines are crucial for understanding the sequence of events in an attack.
    *   Use tools like Timeline Explorer or Plaso to create timelines from various data sources.
    *   Look for patterns and anomalies in the timeline to identify suspicious activity.

**Subtopic 7: Statistical Metrics**

*   **Concept:** Applying statistical analysis to identify anomalies and outliers in your data.

*   **Explanation:**  This involves calculating metrics like averages, standard deviations, and percentiles to identify data points that deviate significantly from the norm.

*   **Examples:**

    *   **Splunk (SPL):**

        ```splunk
        # Calculate the average number of bytes sent per host
        index=main | stats avg(bytes_sent) as avg_bytes by host

        # Identify hosts that sent significantly more bytes than average (e.g., more than 2 standard deviations above the mean)
        index=main | stats avg(bytes_sent) as avg_bytes, stdev(bytes_sent) as stdev_bytes by host
        | where bytes_sent > (avg_bytes + 2*stdev_bytes)
        ```

    *   **Azure Sentinel (KQL):**

        ```kql
        // Calculate the average number of bytes sent per host
        NetworkTraffic
        | summarize avg(Bytes) by SrcIP

        // Identify hosts that sent significantly more bytes than average (e.g., more than 2 standard deviations above the mean)
        let avgBytes = NetworkTraffic | summarize avg(Bytes);
        let stdevBytes = NetworkTraffic | summarize stdev(Bytes);
        NetworkTraffic
        | where Bytes > (tolong(avgBytes) + 2*tolong(stdevBytes))
        ```

*   **Key Takeaways:**
    *   Identify metrics that are relevant to your analysis (e.g., bytes sent, login attempts, CPU usage).
    *   Calculate averages, standard deviations, and other statistical measures.
    *   Use these metrics to identify outliers and anomalies.

**Subtopic 8: Data Aggregation**

*   **Concept:** Combining data from multiple sources to gain a more complete and contextual understanding of an event.

*   **Explanation:**  Threat hunting often requires correlating information from different logs, network traffic, and endpoint data. Data aggregation allows you to bring these disparate sources together to create a more holistic view.

*   **Examples:**

    *   **Scenario:** Investigating a suspicious login event.

    *   **Data Sources:**
        *   Authentication logs (e.g., Windows Event Logs, Linux auth.log)
        *   Network traffic logs (e.g., NetFlow, Zeek logs)
        *   Endpoint logs (e.g., Sysmon logs)

    *   **Aggregation Steps:**

        1.  **Identify the user account and timestamp of the suspicious login event from the authentication logs.**
        2.  **Search the network traffic logs for connections originating from the IP address associated with the login event around the same time.**
        3.  **Search the endpoint logs on the host associated with the login event for any process executions or file modifications that occurred shortly after the login.**

    *   **Tools:** SIEMs are specifically designed for data aggregation and correlation.

*   **Key Takeaways:**
    *   Identify the different data sources that are relevant to your investigation.
    *   Correlate events based on common fields (e.g., IP address, username, timestamp).
    *   Use a SIEM or other data aggregation tool to automate the process.

**Subtopic 9: Frequency Analysis**

*   **Concept:** Determining the number of times a specific event occurs within a certain timeframe.

*   **Explanation:** It helps in identifying unusual spikes or dips in event occurrences that may indicate malicious activity. For example, a sudden increase in failed login attempts or a surge in network traffic to a specific IP address.

*   **Examples:**

    *   **Linux (Command Line):**

        ```bash
        # Count the number of SSH login attempts per minute
        cat /var/log/auth.log | grep "Accepted publickey" | awk '{print substr($1,1,16)}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
        ```

    *   **Splunk (SPL):**

        ```splunk
        # Count the number of events by type in the last 24 hours
        index=main | timechart count by eventtype
        ```

    *   **Azure Sentinel (KQL):**

        ```kql
        // Count the number of events by type over time
        SecurityEvent
        | summarize count() by EventID, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
        | render timechart
        ```

*   **Key Takeaways:**
    *   Useful for identifying sudden spikes or dips in event occurrences.
    *   Can be combined with other analysis techniques for more accurate threat detection.

**Subtopic 10: Distribution Analysis**

*   **Concept:** Analyzing how data is distributed to identify outliers or anomalies.

*   **Explanation:** It is based on the principle that normal data follows a predictable distribution. By analyzing the distribution, you can identify data points that deviate significantly from the norm, which may indicate malicious activity.

*   **Examples:**

    *   **Splunk (SPL):**

        ```splunk
        # Analyze the distribution of request sizes in web server logs
        index=web sourcetype=access_combined | stats count, min(bytes), max(bytes), avg(bytes), stdev(bytes) by clientip
        ```

    *   **Azure Sentinel (KQL):**

        ```kql
        // Analyze the distribution of bytes transferred
        NetworkTraffic
        | summarize count(), min(Bytes), max(Bytes), avg(Bytes), stdev(Bytes)
        ```

*   **Key Takeaways:**
    *   Helps in identifying data points that deviate significantly from the norm.
    *   Useful for detecting anomalies in network traffic, user behavior, and system activity.

```

**Tasks:**

1.  **Basic Search and Filtering:**  Find all requests for `/admin.php` and `/config.php`.
2.  **Grouping and Counting:** Count the number of requests per IP address. Which IP address made the most requests?
3.  **Pattern Matching:** Use regular expressions to identify any requests with suspicious file extensions (e.g., `.exe`, `.bat`, `.sh`).
4.  **Timelines:** (If you have a larger dataset with more events over time) Create a timeline of events for a specific IP address.
5.  **Statistical Metrics:** (If you have a dataset with request sizes) Calculate the average request size and identify any requests that are significantly larger than average.

**Deliverables:**

*   A report summarizing your findings, including the specific commands or queries you used.
*   A description of any suspicious activity you identified and why you consider it suspicious.
