**Slide 1: Module 5: Endpoint & Log Threat Hunting - Introduction**

*   Endpoints (desktops, servers) are prime targets for attackers.
*   Logs contain valuable evidence of malicious activity.
*   This module covers tools and techniques for proactive threat hunting on endpoints and within logs.
*   We will explore EDR, Sysmon, Windows Event Logs, Linux Audit Logs, and SIEMs.

**Narration Script:**
"Welcome to Module 5: Endpoint and Log Threat Hunting! In this module, we'll be focusing on two critical areas for identifying malicious activity: endpoints and logs. Endpoints, like desktops and servers, are often the first point of entry for attackers, making them a prime target. Logs, on the other hand, provide a treasure trove of information about what's happening on our systems. We'll cover a range of tools and techniques to proactively hunt for threats in these environments, including Endpoint Detection and Response solutions, Sysmon, Windows Event Logs, Linux Audit Logs, and Security Information and Event Management systems."

**Slide 2: EDR Solutions: Advanced Endpoint Visibility**

*   **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response):** Real-time monitoring, behavioral analysis, and automated response on endpoints.
*   Key features: Real-time monitoring, Behavioral analysis, Threat intelligence integration, Automated response, Forensic analysis, Endpoint isolation.
*   Examples: CrowdStrike Falcon, SentinelOne, Carbon Black, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

**Narration Script:**
"Let's start with Endpoint Detection and Response, or EDR, solutions. These are advanced security tools that go beyond traditional antivirus by providing real-time monitoring, behavioral analysis, and automated response capabilities on endpoints. Key features include continuous monitoring of endpoint activity, behavioral analysis to identify suspicious patterns, threat intelligence integration to correlate activity with known threats, automated response to contain and remediate incidents, forensic analysis for investigation, and endpoint isolation to prevent further spread. Some popular EDR solutions include CrowdStrike Falcon, SentinelOne, Carbon Black, and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Remember though, that we'll focus on techniques that can be applied even without a full EDR deployment."

**Slide 3: EDR for Threat Hunting: Proactive Investigation**

*   Search for Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) across endpoints.
*   Identify suspicious behavior patterns (behavioral hunting).
*   Leverage threat intelligence feeds within the EDR.
*   Example scenarios: Lateral movement, malware execution, command and control (C2) activity.

**Narration Script:**
"EDR tools are invaluable for proactive threat hunting. You can use them to search for specific Indicators of Compromise, or IoCs, like IP addresses, domain names, and file hashes across all your endpoints. They also allow you to identify suspicious behavior patterns, a process called behavioral hunting. By leveraging the EDR's integrated threat intelligence feeds, you can identify potential threats targeting your organization.  Common threat hunting scenarios include looking for lateral movement, malware execution, and command and control activity."

**Slide 4: Sysmon: Detailed Windows System Monitoring**

*   **Sysmon (System Monitor):** Free Windows system service logging detailed activity to the Event Log.
*   Configured with an XML configuration file (sysmonconfig.xml).
*   Key Event Types: Process Create, Network Connection, Image Load, File Create, Registry Events.
*   Download: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon)

**Narration Script:**
"Next, let's discuss Sysmon, a free and powerful Windows system service that logs detailed information about system activity to the Windows Event Log. Sysmon is configured using an XML configuration file, which allows you to specify which events to log and how to filter them. Key event types to monitor include Process Create, Network Connection, Image Load, File Create, and Registry Events. You can download Sysmon from the Microsoft Sysinternals website at the link shown on the slide."

**Slide 5: Sysmon Analysis: Detecting Suspicious Activity**

*   Sysmon logs are stored in the Windows Event Log (Applications and Services Logs\Microsoft\Windows\Sysmon\Operational).
*   Tools for analysis: Event Viewer, PowerShell, SIEM systems, Elasticsearch/Kibana.
*   Example scenarios: PowerShell obfuscation, process injection, lateral movement, malware persistence.

**Narration Script:**
"Sysmon logs are stored in the Windows Event Log under the path shown on the slide.  You can analyze these logs using a variety of tools, including the built-in Event Viewer, PowerShell, SIEM systems, and Elasticsearch/Kibana for visualization. Common threat hunting scenarios using Sysmon include detecting PowerShell obfuscation, process injection, lateral movement, and malware persistence. By analyzing Sysmon logs, you can gain valuable insights into system activity and identify potential threats."

**Slide 6: Windows Event Logs: A Record of System Events**

*   Windows Event Logs record application, security, and system events.
*   Key Event Logs: Application, Security (most relevant), System.
*   Each entry contains: Event ID, Source, Time Generated, User, Computer, Description, EventData.
*   PowerShell's `Get-WinEvent` cmdlet is used for querying.

**Narration Script:**
"Now let's move on to Windows Event Logs. These logs record a wide range of system events, including application errors, security events, and system events. The key event logs for threat hunting are the Application, Security, and System logs, with the Security log being the most relevant. Each event log entry contains valuable information, such as the Event ID, Source, Time Generated, User, Computer, Description, and EventData. PowerShell's `Get-WinEvent` cmdlet provides a powerful way to query and analyze these logs."

---

**Slide 7: PowerShell for Event Log Analysis: Filtering and Extraction**

*   `Get-WinEvent -LogName Security -MaxEvents 10`: Retrieves the 10 most recent security events.
*   `-FilterXPath`:  Allows filtering by Event ID and other criteria.
*   `ForEach-Object`: Extracts specific data from each event.
*   Example: Extracting TimeCreated, AccountName, and SourceNetworkAddress from logon events.

**Narration Script:**
"PowerShell is an invaluable tool for analyzing Windows Event Logs. The `Get-WinEvent` cmdlet allows you to retrieve events from specific logs. The `-FilterXPath` parameter lets you filter events based on Event ID and other criteria. The `ForEach-Object` cmdlet allows you to iterate through the results and extract specific data from each event. As shown in the example, you can extract information such as the TimeCreated, AccountName, and SourceNetworkAddress from logon events."

**Slide 8: Linux Audit Logs: System Call Monitoring with `auditd`**

*   `auditd` (Audit Daemon): Linux subsystem logging system calls and security-related events.
*   Configuration file: `/etc/audit/auditd.conf`.
*   Audit rules defined in `/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules`.
*   Key command: `ausearch` for querying the logs.

**Narration Script:**
"On Linux systems, the `auditd` subsystem is responsible for logging system calls and other security-related events. The configuration file for `auditd` is located at `/etc/audit/auditd.conf`, and audit rules are defined in `/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules`. The `ausearch` command is the primary tool for querying and analyzing the audit logs. By configuring appropriate audit rules, you can monitor a wide range of system activity and detect suspicious behavior."
