</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Narration Script:</strong>
&quot;Welcome to Module 1 of our Cyber Threat Hunting 101 course! In this module, &#39;The Need for Proactive Security,&#39; we will explore why relying solely on reactive security measures is no longer sufficient in today&#39;s complex threat landscape. We&#39;ll dive into the limitations of traditional defenses and lay the groundwork for understanding the necessity of a proactive threat hunting approach. By the end of this module, you&#39;ll understand why simply reacting to incidents isn&#39;t enough and why actively hunting for threats is crucial.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Slide 2: Title: The Swiss Cheese Model: Understanding Layered Defenses</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Key Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Explanation of the Swiss Cheese Model and its relevance to cybersecurity.</li>
<li>Highlighting that no single security control is perfect and vulnerabilities exist in every layer.</li>
<li>Illustrative examples of layers (Firewall, IDS/IPS, Antivirus) and their potential weaknesses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Narration Script:</strong>
&quot;Let&#39;s begin with the Swiss Cheese Model. Imagine multiple slices of Swiss cheese stacked together, each representing a security control. Each slice has holes, representing vulnerabilities. If the holes align across all slices, a threat can pass through. This illustrates that no single security control is perfect. Even with multiple layers, vulnerabilities exist. Reactive security relies on these layers working perfectly, which they rarely do. For example, a firewall might block common port scans but miss sophisticated evasion techniques. An IDS might detect known malware signatures but fail to identify zero-day exploits. And Antivirus software might catch some malware but be bypassed by fileless attacks. The key takeaway is that layers are good, but not infallible.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Slide 3: Title: Scope X: The Unknown Unknowns</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Key Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to the concept of &quot;Scope X&quot; â€“ the things you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know.</li>
<li>Emphasizing that reactive security is limited by what you already know.</li>
<li>Examples of Scope X: Zero-day vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, supply chain attacks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Narration Script:</strong>
&quot;Now, let&#39;s consider &#39;Scope X&#39;, also known as the &#39;unknown unknowns&#39;. These are the things you <em>don&#39;t know</em> that you <em>don&#39;t know</em>. This represents the blind spots in your security visibility. Reactive security is inherently limited by what you <em>already</em> know. You can&#39;t defend against what you can&#39;t see. Scope X is where the most dangerous and successful attacks often originate. Examples include a zero-day vulnerability in a widely used library, a misconfiguration in a cloud environment exposing data, or a sophisticated supply chain attack. Understanding Scope X is critical to grasping the need for proactive measures.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Slide 4: Title: The Security, Usability, and Cost Triangle: Balancing Act</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Key Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Explanation of the trade-offs between Security, Usability, and Cost.</li>
<li>Illustrating that increasing one aspect can negatively impact the others.</li>
<li>Examples of different scenarios and their impact on the triangle&#39;s vertices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Narration Script:</strong>
&quot;Security, usability, and cost are often competing factors. Think of it as a triangle. Increasing one aspect can negatively impact the others. For example, implementing very strict security policies might make systems difficult to use and require expensive resources to maintain. Effective security requires finding the right balance. It&#39;s not about achieving 100% security, which is impossible, but about mitigating risk to an acceptable level while maintaining usability and cost-effectiveness. High security might mean low usability and high cost, such as multi-factor authentication with complex passwords. Low security might mean high usability and low cost, like simple passwords, but is highly vulnerable to attacks. Find the right balance for your specific needs.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Slide 5: Title: Reactive vs. Proactive Security: A Comparison</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Key Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Defining and contrasting Reactive and Proactive Security approaches.</li>
<li>Highlighting the focus, tools, and limitations of each approach.</li>
<li>Analogies: Ambulance (Reactive) vs. Safety Inspector (Proactive).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Narration Script:</strong>
&quot;Let&#39;s compare Reactive and Proactive Security. Reactive security involves responding to security incidents <em>after</em> they occur. It focuses on detection, containment, and remediation, using tools like firewalls, IDS/IPS, and antivirus. However, it has limited visibility into unknown threats and relies on predefined signatures. Proactive security, on the other hand, aims to identify and mitigate security risks <em>before</em> they are exploited. It focuses on prevention and hunting for threats, using tools like vulnerability scanners and threat intelligence platforms. Think of reactive security as an ambulance waiting for an accident, while proactive security is the safety inspector proactively fixing hazards. The key difference is timing and focus.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Slide 6: Title: Proactive Cybersecurity Methods: A Brief Overview</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Key Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Listing various proactive cybersecurity methods: Vulnerability Assessments, Penetration Testing, Red Teaming, Bug Bounties, Threat Hunting, UEBA, and Threat Intelligence.</li>
<li>Briefly explaining each method&#39;s purpose and function.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Narration Script:</strong>
&quot;There are several proactive cybersecurity methods that organizations can employ. Vulnerability Assessments identify known vulnerabilities, while Penetration Testing simulates real-world attacks. Red Teaming is a more comprehensive simulation of an advanced persistent threat. Bug Bounties incentivize external researchers to find vulnerabilities. Threat Hunting proactively searches for malicious activity that has bypassed existing controls. User and Entity Behavior Analytics, or UEBA, analyzes user and system behavior to detect anomalies. And Threat Intelligence involves gathering and analyzing information about threats to improve your security posture. Each of these methods plays a role in a proactive security strategy.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Slide 7: Title: Why Threat Hunting is Crucial Today</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Key Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reasons why threat hunting is essential in the modern threat landscape: Advanced Threats, Evolving Attack Surfaces, Insider Threats, Zero-Day Exploits, Compliance Requirements, and Proactive Approach.</li>
<li>Emphasizing the proactive nature of threat hunting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Narration Script:</strong>
&quot;Why is threat hunting so crucial today? Modern attacks are increasingly sophisticated and evade traditional security controls. The attack surface is constantly expanding with cloud computing, IoT, and mobile devices. Insider threats pose a significant risk. Zero-day exploits exploit vulnerabilities before they are known. Many regulations require proactive security measures. Threat hunting provides a proactive approach, allowing organizations to identify and mitigate threats <em>before</em> they cause damage. In short, the evolving threat landscape demands a proactive, threat-hunting mindset.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Slide 8: Title: Holistic Approach: People, Processes, and Technology</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Key Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Highlighting the importance of a holistic approach involving People, Processes, and Technology.</li>
<li>Explaining how these three elements are interdependent and essential for effective security.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Narration Script:</strong>
&quot;Effective security requires a holistic approach, encompassing people, processes, and technology. Skilled security professionals are essential, requiring training, awareness programs, and a strong security culture. Well-defined processes are needed for threat hunting, incident response, and vulnerability management. The right tools and technologies are needed to collect, analyze, and visualize security data. These three elements are interdependent. Even the best technology is useless without skilled people and well-defined processes. A strong security posture requires all three working in harmony.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Slide 9: Title: Case Study: Learning from the Past</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Key Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mentioning a major breach (e.g., Target, Equifax, SolarWinds) as an example.</li>
<li>Highlighting how threat hunting could have prevented or mitigated the breach.</li>
<li>Analyzing the attack, vulnerabilities, and potential proactive measures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Narration Script:</strong>
&quot;Let&#39;s consider a real-world example. Think about a major breach like the Target data breach, the Equifax data breach, or the SolarWinds supply chain attack. By analyzing how these attackers gained access, what vulnerabilities they exploited, and what indicators of compromise were present, we can see how threat hunting could have potentially prevented or mitigated the damage. What proactive measures could have been taken? What data sources could have been used? What threat hunting scenarios could have been developed? By studying past breaches, we can learn valuable lessons and improve our proactive security strategies.&quot;</p>
</li>

</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Slide 2: Defining Cyber Threat Hunting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Key Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Proactive, hypothesis-driven search for hidden threats.</li>
<li>Iterative process, refining the hunt based on findings.</li>
<li>Human-led activity, relying on hunter skills and intuition.</li>
<li>Data-driven, leveraging various data sources for evidence.</li>
<li>Distinction from Incident Response (reactive vs. proactive).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Narration Script:</strong> &quot;So, what exactly <em>is</em> cyber threat hunting? It&#39;s a <em>proactive</em> security activity. Unlike incident response, which reacts to alerts, threat hunting involves actively searching for threats that have evaded existing defenses. It&#39;s a hypothesis-driven, iterative, human-led, and data-driven process. We start with a question, use our skills to analyze data, and refine our hunt based on what we find. The key difference from incident response is that threat hunting is proactive â€“ we&#39;re looking for trouble before it finds us.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Slide 3: Scope of Cyber Threat Hunting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Key Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Network: Analyzing traffic for anomalies (e.g., unusual connections).</li>
<li>Endpoints: Examining behavior for suspicious activity (e.g., malware execution).</li>
<li>Logs: Searching for indicators of compromise (IoCs) across systems.</li>
<li>Cloud: Investigating cloud infrastructure for security threats (e.g., misconfigurations).</li>
<li>Requires a broad understanding of the IT environment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Narration Script:</strong> &quot;The scope of threat hunting is quite broad. It encompasses various areas of your IT environment. This includes the network, where we analyze traffic for unusual patterns; endpoints, where we examine user and system behavior for suspicious activity; logs, where we search for telltale signs of compromise; and the cloud, where we investigate cloud infrastructure for security threats. A successful threat hunter needs a broad understanding of the entire IT environment to effectively search for hidden threats.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Slide 4: Core Principles: Understanding Historical Threats</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Key Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Knowing past attacks helps anticipate future attacks.</li>
<li>Review historical security reports and incident reports.</li>
<li>Analyze past threat intelligence data.</li>
<li>Example: Hunting for specific ransomware group tactics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Narration Script:</strong> &quot;One of the core principles of threat hunting is understanding historical threats. Knowing what attacks have happened in the past, especially those targeting your industry or organization, allows us to better anticipate future attacks. This involves reviewing historical security reports, incident reports, and threat intelligence. For example, if we know a particular ransomware group targeted our industry last year, we can proactively hunt for their specific tactics and tools in our network.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Slide 5: Core Principles: Analyzing Current Threats</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Key Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Staying up-to-date on current threats.</li>
<li>Monitor threat intelligence feeds, security blogs, and vulnerability databases.</li>
<li>Hunt for the latest malware, exploits, and attack techniques.</li>
<li>Example: Hunting for exploitation attempts of a new zero-day vulnerability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Narration Script:</strong> &quot;Equally important is analyzing current threats. The threat landscape is constantly evolving, so we need to stay up-to-date on the latest threats. This means monitoring threat intelligence feeds, reading security blogs, and keeping an eye on vulnerability databases. For example, if a new zero-day vulnerability is announced, we can immediately hunt for exploitation attempts in our environment.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Slide 6: Core Principles: Predicting Potential Future Threats</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Key Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Anticipating future attacks to prepare defenses.</li>
<li>Analyze trends in the threat landscape.</li>
<li>Conduct threat modeling.</li>
<li>Monitor emerging technologies and their potential vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Example: Hunting for misconfigurations in cloud environments based on cloud attack trends.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Narration Script:</strong> &quot;Beyond the past and present, we also need to try to predict potential future threats. This allows us to prepare our defenses and proactively hunt for vulnerabilities. We can achieve this by analyzing trends in the threat landscape, conducting threat modeling exercises, and monitoring emerging technologies for potential vulnerabilities. For instance, if we see a growing trend of attacks targeting cloud infrastructure, we can proactively hunt for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in our cloud environment.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Slide 7: The Threat Hunting Loop: Plan &amp; Hunt</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Key Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plan:</strong> Define scope, formulate hypothesis, identify data sources, select tools.</li>
<li><strong>Hunt:</strong> Collect and analyze data based on the plan.</li>
<li>Example hypothesis: &quot;A user&#39;s machine is beaconing to a known C2 server.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Narration Script:</strong> &quot;The Threat Hunting Loop provides a structured approach to threat hunting. It begins with the <em>Plan</em> phase. Here, we define the scope of our hunt, formulate a hypothesis, identify the data sources we&#39;ll need to analyze, and select the appropriate tools. This is followed by the <em>Hunt</em> phase, where we collect data from our chosen sources and analyze it, looking for evidence to support or refute our hypothesis. For example, our hypothesis might be that a user&#39;s machine is beaconing to a known command-and-control server, and we would then analyze network traffic and endpoint logs to look for evidence of this activity.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Slide 8: The Threat Hunting Loop: Analyze, Report &amp; Improve</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Key Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Analyze:</strong> Evaluate findings, investigate further, refine hypothesis.</li>
<li><strong>Report:</strong> Document findings, share with stakeholders.</li>
<li><strong>Improve:</strong> Review process, update security controls, share lessons learned.</li>
<li>Iterative process: Continuously refining and improving.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Narration Script:</strong> &quot;After the Hunt phase, we move to <em>Analyze</em>. We evaluate our findings, investigate further if we find something suspicious, and refine our hypothesis based on our results. Next is <em>Report</em>, where we document our findings, including the evidence we found, the impact of the threat, and any actions taken. We then share our findings with other security teams and stakeholders. Finally, we <em>Improve</em> our process by reviewing what worked well, what could be improved, updating our security controls, and sharing lessons learned. This is an iterative process, constantly refining our approach and improving our effectiveness.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Slide 9: The Pyramid of Pain</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Key Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Categorizes IoCs based on attacker effort to change.</li>
<li>Levels: Hash Values, IP Addresses, Domain Names, Network/Host Artifacts, Tools, TTPs.</li>
<li>Focus on higher levels (TTPs) for maximum impact.</li>
<li>Example: Identifying PowerShell usage as a TTP.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Narration Script:</strong> &quot;The Pyramid of Pain, developed by David Bianco, is a crucial framework for prioritizing our threat hunting efforts. It categorizes indicators of compromise (IoCs) based on how much effort it takes for an attacker to change them. The higher up the pyramid we go, the more difficult and costly it is for the attacker to adapt. At the bottom are simple indicators like Hash Values, which are easily changed. At the top are TTPs â€“ Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures â€“ which represent the <em>way</em> an attacker operates and are the hardest to change. We should focus our efforts on identifying and hunting for these higher-level indicators, as they provide the most lasting value.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Slide 10: Key Enablers and Threat Intelligence</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Key Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Enablers:</strong> Total Visibility, Data Quality &amp; Availability, Situational Awareness.</li>
<li><strong>Threat Intelligence:</strong> Leverage feeds to identify IoCs, develop scenarios, and prioritize hunts.</li>
<li><strong>Threat Modeling:</strong> Understand attack vectors and potential targets.</li>
<li>These enablers are <em>essential</em> for successful threat hunting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Narration Script:</strong> &quot;Finally, let&#39;s discuss the key enablers for successful threat hunting: Total Visibility, meaning access to relevant data sources; Data Quality and Availability, ensuring reliable and accessible data; and Situational Awareness, understanding the environment and context. We also need to leverage Threat Intelligence to identify IoCs, develop threat hunting scenarios, and prioritize our efforts. And Threat Modeling helps us understand potential attack vectors and targets. These enablers, combined with our understanding of the Threat Hunting Loop and the Pyramid of Pain, are essential for effective threat hunting.&quot;</p>

<p>Okay, here are 10 slides for Module 4, &quot;Threat Hunting Tools and Techniques (Part 1: Network),&quot; based on the provided content, formatted in Markdown with detailed narrations.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Slide 1: Module 4: Network Threat Hunting - Introduction</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Title:</strong> Module 4: Network Threat Hunting - Introduction</li>
<li><strong>Bullet Points:</strong><ul>
<li>Proactive hunting for malicious activity that bypasses existing defenses.</li>
<li>Focus on network anomalies, patterns, and indicators of compromise (IoCs).</li>
<li>Driven by hypotheses, threat intelligence, and understanding of network behavior.</li>
<li>Key data sources: PCAP files, NetFlow, NIDS alerts, DNS logs, Proxy logs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Narration Script:</strong>
&quot;Welcome to Module 4, where we&#39;ll be diving into the exciting world of Network Threat Hunting! Unlike traditional security approaches, which react to known threats, network threat hunting is all about proactively searching for malicious activity that might have slipped past your existing defenses. We&#39;ll learn how to identify anomalies, spot suspicious patterns, and uncover indicators of compromise in network traffic. This process is driven by informed hypotheses, leveraging threat intelligence, and a deep understanding of how networks typically behave. The key to effective network threat hunting lies in the data; we&#39;ll be using PCAP files containing packet captures, NetFlow data that summarizes network traffic, alerts from Network Intrusion Detection Systems, DNS logs, and Proxy logs.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Slide 2: Why Network Threat Hunting?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Title:</strong> Why Network Threat Hunting?</li>
<li><strong>Bullet Points:</strong><ul>
<li>Traditional security tools are often reactive and signature-based.</li>
<li>Advanced attackers bypass defenses using stealthy techniques.</li>
<li>Network traffic provides a rich and often overlooked source of data.</li>
<li>Uncover: Command &amp; Control, Data Exfiltration, Lateral Movement, Malware Infections.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Narration Script:</strong>
&quot;So, why should we bother with network threat hunting? The simple answer is that traditional security tools, relying on signatures and known patterns, are often reactive and struggle against advanced attackers. These attackers employ stealthy techniques designed to bypass conventional defenses. The network, however, provides a rich and often underutilized source of data. By analyzing network traffic, we can uncover malicious activities such as Command and Control communications where attackers control compromised systems, Data Exfiltration where sensitive data is being stolen, Lateral Movement as attackers move through a network, and of course, Malware Infections.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Slide 3: NIDS with Snort/Suricata - Introduction</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Title:</strong> NIDS with Snort/Suricata - Introduction</li>
<li><strong>Bullet Points:</strong><ul>
<li>Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) monitor traffic based on rules.</li>
<li>Generate alerts for suspicious activity.</li>
<li>Can be signature-based or anomaly-based.</li>
<li>Snort and Suricata are popular open-source options.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Narration Script:</strong>
&quot;Let&#39;s move on to Network Intrusion Detection Systems, or NIDS, and specifically focus on two popular open-source options: Snort and Suricata. NIDS act as sentinels, monitoring network traffic based on a predefined set of rules. When they detect activity that matches these rules, they generate alerts. These rules can be signature-based, looking for specific patterns, or anomaly-based, identifying deviations from normal network behavior. Snort and Suricata are powerful tools for identifying known threats and suspicious activities on your network.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Slide 4: Snort/Suricata - Configuration &amp; Rule Syntax</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Title:</strong> Snort/Suricata - Configuration &amp; Rule Syntax</li>
<li><strong>Bullet Points:</strong><ul>
<li>Configuration files in <code>/etc/snort</code> or <code>/etc/suricata</code>.</li>
<li>Key options: <code>HOME_NET</code>, <code>EXTERNAL_NET</code>, <code>RULE_PATH</code>, <code>INTERFACE</code>.</li>
<li>Rule Structure: <code>action protocol src_ip src_port -&gt; dest_ip dest_port (options)</code>.</li>
<li>Common Options: <code>msg</code>, <code>content</code>, <code>sid</code>, <code>rev</code>, <code>classtype</code>, <code>flags</code>, <code>dsize</code>, <code>ttl</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Narration Script:</strong>
&quot;To effectively use Snort or Suricata, we need to understand how to configure them and write rules. The main configuration files are located in <code>/etc/snort</code> or <code>/etc/suricata</code>, depending on which one you&#39;re using. Key configuration options include <code>HOME_NET</code>, which defines your internal network, <code>EXTERNAL_NET</code>, usually the internet, <code>RULE_PATH</code>, specifying where your rules are stored, and <code>INTERFACE</code>, the network interface to monitor. The rules themselves follow a specific syntax: <code>action protocol src_ip src_port -&gt; dest_ip dest_port (options)</code>. The <em>action</em> determines what happens when a rule is matched. Common options allow you to specify details like the alert message (<code>msg</code>), specific content to look for (<code>content</code>), a unique rule ID (<code>sid</code>), and other criteria like TCP flags, packet size, and Time-To-Live.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Slide 5: Snort/Suricata - Rule Examples</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Title:</strong> Snort/Suricata - Rule Examples</li>
<li><strong>Bullet Points:</strong><ul>
<li>Detecting ICMP Traffic: <code>alert icmp any any -&gt; any any (msg:&quot;ICMP Traffic Detected&quot;; sid:1000001; rev:1;)</code>.</li>
<li>HTTP with &quot;malware.exe&quot;: <code>alert tcp any any -&gt; any 80 (msg:&quot;HTTP Traffic with malware.exe&quot;; content:&quot;malware.exe&quot;; http_uri; sid:1000002; rev:1;)</code>.</li>
<li>Suspicious User-Agent: <code>alert tcp any any -&gt; any 80 (msg:&quot;Suspicious User-Agent&quot;; content:&quot;BadBot/1.0&quot;; http_header; sid:1000003; rev:1;)</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Narration Script:</strong>
&quot;Let&#39;s look at some examples of Snort/Suricata rules. This first rule alerts on all ICMP traffic, a simple but useful starting point. The second rule looks for HTTP traffic going to port 80 that contains the string &quot;malware.exe&quot; in the URI, which could indicate a malware download. The third rule flags any HTTP request with the User-Agent string &quot;BadBot/1.0&quot; in the header, potentially indicating a malicious bot. By crafting rules like these, you can tailor your NIDS to detect specific threats relevant to your environment.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Title:</strong> Wireshark - Filters: Capture and Display</li>
<li><strong>Bullet Points:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Capture Filters:</strong> Filter traffic <em>before</em> capture (e.g., <code>tcp port 80</code>, <code>host 192.168.1.100</code>).  Reduces data volume.</li>
<li><strong>Display Filters:</strong> Filter traffic <em>after</em> capture (e.g., <code>http.request.method == &quot;GET&quot;</code>, <code>ip.src == 10.0.0.1 &amp;&amp; tcp.port == 443</code>, <code>http contains &quot;password&quot;</code>).  More flexible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Narration Script:</strong>
&quot;Wireshark offers two types of filters: capture filters and display filters. Capture filters are applied <em>before</em> the traffic is captured, allowing you to reduce the amount of data collected. For example, you can capture only HTTP traffic or traffic to/from a specific host. Display filters, on the other hand, are applied <em>after</em> the capture, giving you more flexibility to analyze the data you&#39;ve already collected. You can filter based on HTTP request methods, IP addresses and ports, or even search for specific strings within the traffic. Understanding and using these filters effectively is crucial for efficient network traffic analysis.&quot;</li>

<li>Windows (PowerShell): <code>Get-WinEvent -LogName System | Group-Object -Property ID | Sort-Object -Property Count -Descending</code></li>
<li>Splunk (SPL): <code>index=main | stats count by src_ip</code></li>
<li>Azure Sentinel (KQL): <code>SecurityEvent | summarize count() by EventID | order by count_ desc</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Narration Script:
&quot;Here are some examples of grouping and counting in action. On Linux, you can use a combination of <code>awk</code>, <code>sort</code>, and <code>uniq</code> to count the number of occurrences of specific events. In Windows PowerShell, the <code>Group-Object</code> cmdlet allows you to group events based on a property and then sort the results by count. Splunk&#39;s <code>stats</code> command provides a powerful way to count events by a specific field. Similarly, Azure Sentinel&#39;s KQL language allows you to summarize data and count events by a specific field. These examples demonstrate how to use grouping and counting to identify patterns and trends in your data.&quot;</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Narration Script:</strong>
&quot;To effectively hunt for threats, we need to understand our adversaries. This slide introduces the concept of TTPs â€“ Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures. TTPs describe <em>how</em> an attacker operates, providing a detailed picture of their methods. Tactics are the high-level strategic goals, like gaining initial access. Techniques are the specific methods used, such as spearphishing. And procedures are the nitty-gritty details of how those techniques are executed. Importantly, TTPs are more durable than IoCs like IP addresses, making them a more reliable target for threat hunting.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Slide 3: Leveraging the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Framework</strong></p>

Finally, we can develop specific scenarios to look for suspicious attachments, unusual process activity, and unusual network connections.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Slide 5: Developing Threat Hunting Hypotheses</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Key Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A threat hunting hypothesis is an educated guess about malicious activity.</li>
<li>Characteristics: Testable, specific, relevant.</li>
<li>Sources: Threat intelligence, internal data, vulnerability assessments, incident reports.</li>
<li>Hypothesis Structure: IF (condition), THEN (expected outcome), BECAUSE (rationale).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Narration Script:</strong>
&quot;Now, let&#39;s talk about developing threat hunting hypotheses. A hypothesis is essentially an educated guess about where malicious activity might be occurring in your environment. A good hypothesis is testable, specific, and relevant to your organization&#39;s threat model. You can draw inspiration from various sources, including threat intelligence feeds, your own internal data, vulnerability assessments, and even past incident reports. A well-formed hypothesis typically follows the &#39;IF-THEN-BECAUSE&#39; structure, clearly outlining the condition you&#39;re looking for, the expected outcome, and the rationale behind your expectation.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Slide 6: Types of Threat Hunting Hypotheses</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Key Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Intelligence-Driven: Based on threat intelligence reports (e.g., APT29 spearphishing).</li>
<li>Anomaly-Driven: Based on unusual patterns in data (e.g., spike in outbound traffic).</li>
<li>Vulnerability-Driven: Based on known vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection attempts).</li>
<li>Behavior-Driven: Based on known malicious behaviors (e.g., PowerShell downloading code).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Narration Script:</strong>
&quot;There are several types of hypotheses you can formulate, each driven by a different source of information. Intelligence-driven hypotheses are based on threat intelligence reports, like the APT29 example we discussed earlier. Anomaly-driven hypotheses focus on unusual patterns in your data, such as a sudden spike in outbound network traffic. Vulnerability-driven hypotheses are based on known vulnerabilities in your systems, like the potential for SQL injection attacks. Finally, behavior-driven hypotheses are based on known malicious behaviors, like PowerShell scripts downloading code from the internet.&quot;</p>

</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Slide 8: Example: Testing the Compromised Account Hypothesis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Key Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hypothesis: Login from distant locations indicates a compromised account.</li>
<li>Data Source: Security logs (Windows Event Logs).</li>
<li>Tools: SIEM (Splunk, Sentinel).</li>
<li>Example Splunk query to identify multiple logins from different locations.</li>
<li>Interpretation: Accounts with logins from distant locations warrant further investigation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Narration Script:</strong>
&quot;Let&#39;s walk through an example of testing a hypothesis. Our hypothesis is that a user account logging in from multiple geographically distant locations within a short period of time may indicate a compromised account. To test this, we&#39;ll use security logs, specifically Windows Event Logs, and a SIEM like Splunk or Sentinel. The slide shows an example Splunk query that can identify accounts with logins from multiple locations. If the query returns such accounts, it supports our hypothesis and warrants further investigation to confirm the compromise.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Slide 9: Documenting Threat Hunting Scenarios and Creating Playbooks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Key Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Documentation is crucial for knowledge sharing, reproducibility, training, and improvement.</li>
<li>Scenario Document Elements: Title, description, threat actor, TTPs, hypothesis, data sources, tools, analysis steps, expected results, false positives, remediation steps, references.</li>
<li>Playbooks: Step-by-step guides for responding to detected threats.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Narration Script:</strong>
&quot;Documenting your threat hunting scenarios is essential for several reasons: it facilitates knowledge sharing, ensures reproducibility, aids in training new team members, and allows for continuous improvement of your threat hunting process. A comprehensive scenario document should include elements such as the title, description, threat actor, TTPs, hypothesis, data sources, tools, analysis steps, expected results, false positive considerations, remediation steps, and relevant references. In addition to scenario documentation, it&#39;s crucial to create threat hunting playbooks â€“ step-by-step guides that outline the actions to take when a threat is detected, ensuring a consistent and repeatable response.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Narration:</strong> &quot;Your project will be graded based on the planning, implementation, testing and documentation, and presentation and peer review. Keep in mind some key considerations: manage your time effectively, avoid scope creep, use version control to track your changes, collaborate effectively if you&#39;re working in a team, and don&#39;t be afraid to ask for help when you&#39;re stuck. Remember, this is an iterative process, so don&#39;t be afraid to experiment, learn, and adapt as you go along. Good luck, and I look forward to seeing your amazing projects!&quot;</p>
