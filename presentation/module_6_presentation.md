1.  Slide Title: **Basic Search and Filtering**
2.  Bullet Points:
    *   Foundation of any analysis: Quickly find relevant data.
    *   Efficiently narrow down your focus and avoid being overwhelmed by noise.
    *   Use search operators (AND, OR, NOT), wildcards, and filters.
    *   Syntax varies depending on the tool you're using.
3.  Narration Script:
    "Our first subtopic is Basic Search and Filtering. This is the foundation upon which all other data analysis techniques are built. The ability to quickly find relevant data is essential. By mastering efficient search and filtering, you can narrow your focus and avoid being overwhelmed by the sheer volume of data. This involves using search operators like AND, OR, and NOT, as well as wildcards and filters. Remember that the specific syntax will vary depending on the tool you're using, so it's important to understand the capabilities of your chosen platform."

**Slide 3**

1.  Slide Title: **Basic Search and Filtering - Examples**
2.  Bullet Points:
    *   Linux (`grep`): `grep "failed password" /var/log/auth.log`
    *   Windows (PowerShell): `Get-WinEvent -LogName System | Where-Object {$_.Message -like "*error*"}`
    *   Splunk (SPL): `index=main "failed password"`
    *   Azure Sentinel (KQL): `SecurityEvent | where EventID == 4625`
3.  Narration Script:
    "Let's look at some practical examples of basic search and filtering. On Linux, using the `grep` command, you can search for specific strings within log files. In Windows PowerShell, the `Get-WinEvent` cmdlet allows you to query event logs and filter based on properties like message content. Splunk's SPL language provides a straightforward way to search indexed data using keywords. Azure Sentinel's KQL language allows you to query log data and filter results based on specific criteria. These are just a few examples, and the specific syntax will depend on the tool you're using."

**Slide 4**

1.  Slide Title: **Grouping and Counting**
2.  Bullet Points:
    *   Identify patterns and trends by summarizing data.
    *   Look at aggregate data to find anomalies.
    *   Group data based on a specific field (e.g., IP address, user account, event type).
    *   Count the occurrences within each group.
3.  Narration Script:
    "Moving on to Grouping and Counting. This technique allows you to identify patterns and trends by summarizing data. Instead of looking at individual events, you're analyzing aggregate data to find anomalies. This involves grouping data based on a specific field, such as IP address, user account, or event type, and then counting the occurrences within each group. This can reveal unusual activity that might be missed when looking at individual events individually."

**Slide 5**

1.  Slide Title: **Grouping and Counting - Examples**
2.  Bullet Points:
    *   Linux (`awk`, `sort`, `uniq`): `awk '/Failed password/ {print $11}' /var/log/auth.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr`
    *   Windows (PowerShell): `Get-WinEvent -LogName System | Group-Object -Property ID | Sort-Object -Property Count -Descending`
    *   Splunk (SPL): `index=main | stats count by src_ip`
    *   Azure Sentinel (KQL): `SecurityEvent | summarize count() by EventID | order by count_ desc`
3.  Narration Script:
    "Here are some examples of grouping and counting in action. On Linux, you can use a combination of `awk`, `sort`, and `uniq` to count the number of occurrences of specific events. In Windows PowerShell, the `Group-Object` cmdlet allows you to group events based on a property and then sort the results by count. Splunk's `stats` command provides a powerful way to count events by a specific field. Similarly, Azure Sentinel's KQL language allows you to summarize data and count events by a specific field. These examples demonstrate how to use grouping and counting to identify patterns and trends in your data."

1.  Slide Title: **Link Analysis**
2.  Bullet Points:
    *   Visualize relationships between different entities in your data.
    *   Reveal hidden connections and dependencies.
    *   Create a graph or network diagram.
    *   Nodes represent entities, edges represent relationships.
3.  Narration Script:
    "Next up is Link Analysis. This technique helps visualize relationships between different entities in your data, revealing hidden connections and dependencies that are not immediately obvious. Link analysis involves creating a graph or network diagram where nodes represent entities, such as IP addresses, users, or files, and edges represent relationships between them, such as connections, file access, or process execution. This visualization can help you quickly identify patterns and connections that would be difficult to spot otherwise."

**Slide 7**

1.  Slide Title: **Hunting and Query Languages (KQL & SPL)**
2.  Bullet Points:
    *   Write efficient queries to search for specific patterns and anomalies.
    *   Master query languages like KQL (Azure Sentinel) and SPL (Splunk).
    *   Use functions like `geoip`, `stats`, `summarize`, and `where`.
3.  Narration Script:
    "Now, let's discuss Hunting and Query Languages. This is where you learn to write efficient queries to search for specific patterns and anomalies within your data. Each SIEM or log management platform has its own query language, and mastering these languages is crucial for effective threat hunting. We'll focus on KQL, used in Azure Sentinel, and SPL, used in Splunk, as examples. These languages provide powerful functions like `geoip`, `stats`, `summarize`, and `where` to filter and aggregate data."

**Slide 8**

1.  Slide Title: **Pattern Matching (Regular Expressions)**
2.  Bullet Points:
    *   Use regular expressions (regex) to identify malicious patterns in your data.
    *   Essential for identifying malicious URLs, file paths, or command-line arguments.
    *   Learn regex syntax (characters, quantifiers, character classes).
    *   Use online regex testers to experiment.
3.  Narration Script:
    "Pattern Matching is a powerful technique that involves using regular expressions, or regex, to identify malicious patterns in your data. Regular expressions are essential for identifying things like malicious URLs, file paths, or command-line arguments. To master this technique, you'll need to learn the basics of regular expression syntax, including characters, quantifiers, and character classes. I highly recommend using online regex testers to experiment and refine your patterns, and remember to start with simple patterns and gradually increase complexity."

**Slide 9**

1.  Slide Title: **Timelines & Statistical Metrics**
2.  Bullet Points:
    *   Timelines: chronological sequence of events to understand the progression of an attack.
    *   Statistical Metrics: Applying statistical analysis to identify anomalies and outliers.
    *   Calculate metrics like averages, standard deviations, and percentiles.
3.  Narration Script:
    "Let's cover Timelines and Statistical Metrics. Timelines are crucial for understanding the sequence of events in an attack. By creating a chronological sequence of events, you can visualize the order in which they occurred, making it easier to identify the root cause of an incident and understand the attacker's actions. Statistical Metrics involves applying statistical analysis to identify anomalies and outliers in your data. This includes calculating metrics like averages, standard deviations, and percentiles to identify data points that deviate significantly from the norm."

**Slide 10**

1.  Slide Title: **Data Aggregation, Frequency Analysis & Distribution Analysis**
2.  Bullet Points:
    *   Data Aggregation: Combining data from multiple sources for a complete understanding.
    *   Frequency Analysis: Identifying unusual spikes or dips in event occurrences.
    *   Distribution Analysis: Analyzing how data is distributed to identify outliers or anomalies.
3.  Narration Script:
    "Finally, we'll discuss Data Aggregation, Frequency Analysis, and Distribution Analysis. Data Aggregation involves combining data from multiple sources to gain a more complete and contextual understanding of an event. Frequency Analysis helps in identifying unusual spikes or dips in event occurrences that may indicate malicious activity. Distribution Analysis is about analyzing how data is distributed to identify outliers or anomalies. By mastering these techniques, you'll be able to uncover hidden patterns and relationships in your data, making you a more effective threat hunter."
