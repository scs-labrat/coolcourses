**Slide 3**

1.  **Slide Title:** Core Security Skill Set: Network Security - Wireshark in Action

2.  **Bullet Points:**
    *   Following TCP Streams: Reconstruct conversations.
    *   Analyzing Packets: Understand packet structure and fields.
    *   Exercise: Download a PCAP file from malware-traffic-analysis.net
    *   Identify suspicious URLs, DNS queries, or unusual protocols.

3.  **Narration Script:** "Continuing with Network Security, let's talk about putting Wireshark to work. A key skill is 'Following TCP Streams' – this allows you to reconstruct the entire conversation between two computers. You'll also learn to analyze individual packets, understanding the meaning of different fields within the packet structure. For hands-on practice, we'll download a PCAP file – a packet capture – from a site like malware-traffic-analysis.net. You'll then use Wireshark to identify suspicious URLs, DNS queries to unusual domain names, or any unusual protocols indicating potential malicious activity."

**Slide 4**

1.  **Slide Title:** Core Security Skill Set: Endpoint Security

2.  **Bullet Points:**
    *   Importance: Endpoints are often targeted.
    *   Process Monitoring: Task Manager (Windows), `top` (Linux)
    *   File System Monitoring: Process Monitor (Windows), `inotifywait` (Linux)
    *   Registry Monitoring (Windows): Regedit, Process Monitor

3.  **Narration Script:** "Next up is Endpoint Security. Endpoints, such as laptops and servers, are frequent targets for attackers. To defend them, you need to understand normal endpoint behavior. This involves process monitoring – using tools like Task Manager on Windows or the `top` command on Linux to observe running processes. You'll also learn file system monitoring to detect unauthorized changes, and registry monitoring on Windows to identify malicious registry modifications. Understanding what's normal allows you to quickly identify what's abnormal and potentially malicious."

**Slide 5**

1.  **Slide Title:** Core Security Skill Set: Endpoint Security - Practical Examples

2.  **Bullet Points:**
    *   Identify processes with unusual names or high resource usage.
    *   Sysmon (Windows): Essential for detailed endpoint logging.
    *   PowerShell Script (Windows) to list processes and network connections.
    *   Linux Command: `netstat -anp | grep <process_name>`

3.  **Narration Script:** "Let's look at some practical examples of Endpoint Security. You'll learn to identify processes with unusual names, those running from temporary directories, or those consuming excessive resources. On Windows, we'll emphasize the importance of Sysmon – a crucial tool for detailed endpoint logging. We'll also use a PowerShell script to list processes and their associated network connections, providing valuable insights into endpoint activity. On Linux, we can use the `netstat` command to achieve a similar result, helping us identify suspicious network connections originating from specific processes."

**Slide 6**

1.  **Slide Title:** Core Security Skill Set: Malware Analysis Basics

2.  **Bullet Points:**
    *   Importance: Understand how malware works.
    *   Static Analysis: File Hashing, Strings Analysis, File Type Identification
    *   Dynamic Analysis (Sandboxing): Monitor system activity.
    *   Reverse Engineering: Disassemblers (IDA Pro, Ghidra)

3.  **Narration Script:** "Now, let's move on to Malware Analysis Basics. Understanding how malware works is essential for developing effective defenses. We'll cover static analysis techniques, such as calculating file hashes to identify known malware, analyzing strings to find potential indicators of compromise, and identifying file types. We'll also explore dynamic analysis, which involves running malware in a sandboxed environment to observe its behavior. Finally, we'll touch on the basics of reverse engineering, using tools like IDA Pro or Ghidra to analyze the malware's code."

**Slide 7**

1.  **Slide Title:** Core Security Skill Set: Malware Analysis - Strings Analysis Example

2.  **Bullet Points:**
    *   Strings Analysis: `strings malware.exe | grep -E "http|www\.|.com|.exe|.dll|C:\\|HKEY_"`
    *   Caution: Handle malware in a sandboxed environment ONLY.
    *   Tools: VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, Cuckoo Sandbox, PEview, IDA Pro

3.  **Narration Script:** "Let's look at a specific example of strings analysis. On Linux, you can use the command `strings malware.exe | grep -E "http|www\.|.com|.exe|.dll|C:\\|HKEY_"` to extract strings from a file and filter for common indicators of compromise. This can quickly reveal suspicious URLs, file paths, or registry keys. However, I must emphasize: *always* handle malware in a sandboxed environment to prevent infection. We'll also introduce you to a range of tools, including VirusTotal and Hybrid Analysis for online analysis, Cuckoo Sandbox for automated analysis, PEview for examining Windows executables, and IDA Pro for advanced reverse engineering."
