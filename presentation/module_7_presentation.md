**Slide 2: Understanding Threat Actors and Their TTPs**

*   **Key Content:**
    *   TTPs: Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures – the *how* of an attack.
    *   Tactics: High-level strategic goals (e.g., Initial Access).
    *   Techniques: Specific methods used to achieve a tactic (e.g., Spearphishing).
    *   Procedures: The *specific* steps taken to execute a technique.
    *   TTPs are more durable than IoCs (Indicators of Compromise).

*   **Narration Script:**
    "To effectively hunt for threats, we need to understand our adversaries. This slide introduces the concept of TTPs – Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures. TTPs describe *how* an attacker operates, providing a detailed picture of their methods. Tactics are the high-level strategic goals, like gaining initial access. Techniques are the specific methods used, such as spearphishing. And procedures are the nitty-gritty details of how those techniques are executed. Importantly, TTPs are more durable than IoCs like IP addresses, making them a more reliable target for threat hunting."

**Slide 3: Leveraging the MITRE ATT&CK Framework**

*   **Key Content:**
    *   MITRE ATT&CK: A knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques.
    *   Provides a common language for describing adversary behavior.
    *   Access ATT&CK online or via downloadable versions.
    *   Using ATT&CK: Identify actors, research TTPs, map TTPs to your environment, develop scenarios.

*   **Narration Script:**
    "The MITRE ATT&CK framework is an invaluable resource for understanding adversary behavior. It's a comprehensive knowledge base that catalogs tactics and techniques observed in real-world attacks. ATT&CK provides a common language for describing these behaviors, enabling us to share information and collaborate effectively. You can access ATT&CK online or download it in various formats. To use ATT&CK for threat hunting, start by identifying relevant threat actors, research their TTPs, map those TTPs to your environment, and then develop threat hunting scenarios based on what you've learned."

**Slide 4: TTP Example: APT29 (Cozy Bear)**

*   **Key Content:**
    *   Example: APT29, a Russian-linked threat actor.
    *   TTPs: Spearphishing Attachment, Credential Dumping, Lateral Movement.
    *   Map TTPs to environment: Email logs, endpoint logs, network logs.
    *   Develop scenarios: Suspicious attachments, unusual process activity, unusual connections.

*   **Narration Script:**
    "Let's illustrate this with an example. Consider APT29, also known as Cozy Bear, a sophisticated Russian-linked threat actor. Using the MITRE ATT&CK framework, we can identify some of their common TTPs, such as spearphishing attachments, credential dumping, and lateral movement. We can then map these TTPs to our environment – email logs for spearphishing, endpoint logs for credential dumping, and network logs for lateral movement. Finally, we can develop specific scenarios to look for suspicious attachments, unusual process activity, and unusual network connections."

**Slide 5: Developing Threat Hunting Hypotheses**

*   **Key Content:**
    *   A threat hunting hypothesis is an educated guess about malicious activity.
    *   Characteristics: Testable, specific, relevant.
    *   Sources: Threat intelligence, internal data, vulnerability assessments, incident reports.
    *   Hypothesis Structure: IF (condition), THEN (expected outcome), BECAUSE (rationale).

*   **Narration Script:**
    "Now, let's talk about developing threat hunting hypotheses. A hypothesis is essentially an educated guess about where malicious activity might be occurring in your environment. A good hypothesis is testable, specific, and relevant to your organization's threat model. You can draw inspiration from various sources, including threat intelligence feeds, your own internal data, vulnerability assessments, and even past incident reports. A well-formed hypothesis typically follows the 'IF-THEN-BECAUSE' structure, clearly outlining the condition you're looking for, the expected outcome, and the rationale behind your expectation."

**Slide 6: Types of Threat Hunting Hypotheses**

*   **Key Content:**
    *   Intelligence-Driven: Based on threat intelligence reports (e.g., APT29 spearphishing).
    *   Anomaly-Driven: Based on unusual patterns in data (e.g., spike in outbound traffic).
    *   Vulnerability-Driven: Based on known vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection attempts).
    *   Behavior-Driven: Based on known malicious behaviors (e.g., PowerShell downloading code).

*   **Narration Script:**
    "There are several types of hypotheses you can formulate, each driven by a different source of information. Intelligence-driven hypotheses are based on threat intelligence reports, like the APT29 example we discussed earlier. Anomaly-driven hypotheses focus on unusual patterns in your data, such as a sudden spike in outbound network traffic. Vulnerability-driven hypotheses are based on known vulnerabilities in your systems, like the potential for SQL injection attacks. Finally, behavior-driven hypotheses are based on known malicious behaviors, like PowerShell scripts downloading code from the internet."

**Slide 7: Testing Hypotheses: Data Sources and Techniques**

*   **Key Content:**
    *   Data Sources: Security logs, network traffic, endpoint data, threat intelligence.
    *   Data Analysis Techniques: Searching, filtering, aggregation, correlation, visualization, statistical analysis.
    *   Tools: SIEMs, EDRs, NTA tools, log analysis tools, scripting languages.

*   **Narration Script:**
    "Once you have a hypothesis, the next step is to test it. This requires accessing the right data sources, which can include security logs, network traffic data, endpoint data, and threat intelligence feeds. You'll also need to employ various data analysis techniques, such as searching and filtering, aggregation, correlation, visualization, and statistical analysis. To facilitate this process, there are a wide range of tools available, including SIEMs, EDRs, NTA tools, log analysis tools, and scripting languages like Python and PowerShell."

**Slide 8: Example: Testing the Compromised Account Hypothesis**

*   **Key Content:**
    *   Hypothesis: Login from distant locations indicates a compromised account.
    *   Data Source: Security logs (Windows Event Logs).
    *   Tools: SIEM (Splunk, Sentinel).
    *   Example Splunk query to identify multiple logins from different locations.
    *   Interpretation: Accounts with logins from distant locations warrant further investigation.

*   **Narration Script:**
    "Let's walk through an example of testing a hypothesis. Our hypothesis is that a user account logging in from multiple geographically distant locations within a short period of time may indicate a compromised account. To test this, we'll use security logs, specifically Windows Event Logs, and a SIEM like Splunk or Sentinel. The slide shows an example Splunk query that can identify accounts with logins from multiple locations. If the query returns such accounts, it supports our hypothesis and warrants further investigation to confirm the compromise."

**Slide 9: Documenting Threat Hunting Scenarios and Creating Playbooks**

*   **Key Content:**
    *   Documentation is crucial for knowledge sharing, reproducibility, training, and improvement.
    *   Scenario Document Elements: Title, description, threat actor, TTPs, hypothesis, data sources, tools, analysis steps, expected results, false positives, remediation steps, references.
    *   Playbooks: Step-by-step guides for responding to detected threats.

*   **Narration Script:**
    "Documenting your threat hunting scenarios is essential for several reasons: it facilitates knowledge sharing, ensures reproducibility, aids in training new team members, and allows for continuous improvement of your threat hunting process. A comprehensive scenario document should include elements such as the title, description, threat actor, TTPs, hypothesis, data sources, tools, analysis steps, expected results, false positive considerations, remediation steps, and relevant references. In addition to scenario documentation, it's crucial to create threat hunting playbooks – step-by-step guides that outline the actions to take when a threat is detected, ensuring a consistent and repeatable response."

**Slide 10: Real-World Threat Hunting Scenarios and Case Studies**

*   **Key Content:**
    *   Common Scenarios: Compromised accounts, lateral movement, data exfiltration, malware, insider threats, ransomware.
    *   Case Studies: Target Breach, Equifax Breach, SolarWinds Attack.
    *   Learning from Case Studies: Understand TTPs, vulnerabilities, and mistakes.

*   **Narration Script:**
    "Finally, let's consider some real-world threat hunting scenarios and case studies. Common scenarios include detecting compromised accounts, lateral movement, data exfiltration, malware infections, insider threats, and ransomware activity. By studying past breaches, such as the Target Breach, the Equifax Breach, and the SolarWinds attack, we can learn valuable lessons about the TTPs used by attackers, the vulnerabilities they exploit, and the mistakes that organizations make that allow them to be compromised. This knowledge can then be applied to improve our own threat hunting process and prevent similar attacks from happening to our organization."
