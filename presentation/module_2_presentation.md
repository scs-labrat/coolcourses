**Slide 2: Defining Cyber Threat Hunting**

*   **Key Content:**
    *   Proactive, hypothesis-driven search for hidden threats.
    *   Iterative process, refining the hunt based on findings.
    *   Human-led activity, relying on hunter skills and intuition.
    *   Data-driven, leveraging various data sources for evidence.
    *   Distinction from Incident Response (reactive vs. proactive).

*   **Narration Script:** "So, what exactly *is* cyber threat hunting? It's a *proactive* security activity. Unlike incident response, which reacts to alerts, threat hunting involves actively searching for threats that have evaded existing defenses. It's a hypothesis-driven, iterative, human-led, and data-driven process. We start with a question, use our skills to analyze data, and refine our hunt based on what we find. The key difference from incident response is that threat hunting is proactive – we're looking for trouble before it finds us."

**Slide 3: Scope of Cyber Threat Hunting**

*   **Key Content:**
    *   Network: Analyzing traffic for anomalies (e.g., unusual connections).
    *   Endpoints: Examining behavior for suspicious activity (e.g., malware execution).
    *   Logs: Searching for indicators of compromise (IoCs) across systems.
    *   Cloud: Investigating cloud infrastructure for security threats (e.g., misconfigurations).
    *   Requires a broad understanding of the IT environment.

*   **Narration Script:** "The scope of threat hunting is quite broad. It encompasses various areas of your IT environment. This includes the network, where we analyze traffic for unusual patterns; endpoints, where we examine user and system behavior for suspicious activity; logs, where we search for telltale signs of compromise; and the cloud, where we investigate cloud infrastructure for security threats. A successful threat hunter needs a broad understanding of the entire IT environment to effectively search for hidden threats."

**Slide 4: Core Principles: Understanding Historical Threats**

*   **Key Content:**
    *   Knowing past attacks helps anticipate future attacks.
    *   Review historical security reports and incident reports.
    *   Analyze past threat intelligence data.
    *   Example: Hunting for specific ransomware group tactics.

*   **Narration Script:** "One of the core principles of threat hunting is understanding historical threats. Knowing what attacks have happened in the past, especially those targeting your industry or organization, allows us to better anticipate future attacks. This involves reviewing historical security reports, incident reports, and threat intelligence. For example, if we know a particular ransomware group targeted our industry last year, we can proactively hunt for their specific tactics and tools in our network."

**Slide 5: Core Principles: Analyzing Current Threats**

*   **Key Content:**
    *   Staying up-to-date on current threats.
    *   Monitor threat intelligence feeds, security blogs, and vulnerability databases.
    *   Hunt for the latest malware, exploits, and attack techniques.
    *   Example: Hunting for exploitation attempts of a new zero-day vulnerability.

*   **Narration Script:** "Equally important is analyzing current threats. The threat landscape is constantly evolving, so we need to stay up-to-date on the latest threats. This means monitoring threat intelligence feeds, reading security blogs, and keeping an eye on vulnerability databases. For example, if a new zero-day vulnerability is announced, we can immediately hunt for exploitation attempts in our environment."

**Slide 6: Core Principles: Predicting Potential Future Threats**

*   **Key Content:**
    *   Anticipating future attacks to prepare defenses.
    *   Analyze trends in the threat landscape.
    *   Conduct threat modeling.
    *   Monitor emerging technologies and their potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Example: Hunting for misconfigurations in cloud environments based on cloud attack trends.

*   **Narration Script:** "Beyond the past and present, we also need to try to predict potential future threats. This allows us to prepare our defenses and proactively hunt for vulnerabilities. We can achieve this by analyzing trends in the threat landscape, conducting threat modeling exercises, and monitoring emerging technologies for potential vulnerabilities. For instance, if we see a growing trend of attacks targeting cloud infrastructure, we can proactively hunt for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in our cloud environment."

**Slide 7: The Threat Hunting Loop: Plan & Hunt**

*   **Key Content:**
    *   **Plan:** Define scope, formulate hypothesis, identify data sources, select tools.
    *   **Hunt:** Collect and analyze data based on the plan.
    *   Example hypothesis: "A user's machine is beaconing to a known C2 server."

*   **Narration Script:** "The Threat Hunting Loop provides a structured approach to threat hunting. It begins with the *Plan* phase. Here, we define the scope of our hunt, formulate a hypothesis, identify the data sources we'll need to analyze, and select the appropriate tools. This is followed by the *Hunt* phase, where we collect data from our chosen sources and analyze it, looking for evidence to support or refute our hypothesis. For example, our hypothesis might be that a user's machine is beaconing to a known command-and-control server, and we would then analyze network traffic and endpoint logs to look for evidence of this activity."

**Slide 8: The Threat Hunting Loop: Analyze, Report & Improve**

*   **Key Content:**
    *   **Analyze:** Evaluate findings, investigate further, refine hypothesis.
    *   **Report:** Document findings, share with stakeholders.
    *   **Improve:** Review process, update security controls, share lessons learned.
    *   Iterative process: Continuously refining and improving.

*   **Narration Script:** "After the Hunt phase, we move to *Analyze*. We evaluate our findings, investigate further if we find something suspicious, and refine our hypothesis based on our results. Next is *Report*, where we document our findings, including the evidence we found, the impact of the threat, and any actions taken. We then share our findings with other security teams and stakeholders. Finally, we *Improve* our process by reviewing what worked well, what could be improved, updating our security controls, and sharing lessons learned. This is an iterative process, constantly refining our approach and improving our effectiveness."

**Slide 9: The Pyramid of Pain**

*   **Key Content:**
    *   Categorizes IoCs based on attacker effort to change.
    *   Levels: Hash Values, IP Addresses, Domain Names, Network/Host Artifacts, Tools, TTPs.
    *   Focus on higher levels (TTPs) for maximum impact.
    *   Example: Identifying PowerShell usage as a TTP.

*   **Narration Script:** "The Pyramid of Pain, developed by David Bianco, is a crucial framework for prioritizing our threat hunting efforts. It categorizes indicators of compromise (IoCs) based on how much effort it takes for an attacker to change them. The higher up the pyramid we go, the more difficult and costly it is for the attacker to adapt. At the bottom are simple indicators like Hash Values, which are easily changed. At the top are TTPs – Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures – which represent the *way* an attacker operates and are the hardest to change. We should focus our efforts on identifying and hunting for these higher-level indicators, as they provide the most lasting value."

**Slide 10: Key Enablers and Threat Intelligence**

*   **Key Content:**
    *   **Key Enablers:** Total Visibility, Data Quality & Availability, Situational Awareness.
    *   **Threat Intelligence:** Leverage feeds to identify IoCs, develop scenarios, and prioritize hunts.
    *   **Threat Modeling:** Understand attack vectors and potential targets.
    *   These enablers are *essential* for successful threat hunting.

*   **Narration Script:** "Finally, let's discuss the key enablers for successful threat hunting: Total Visibility, meaning access to relevant data sources; Data Quality and Availability, ensuring reliable and accessible data; and Situational Awareness, understanding the environment and context. We also need to leverage Threat Intelligence to identify IoCs, develop threat hunting scenarios, and prioritize our efforts. And Threat Modeling helps us understand potential attack vectors and targets. These enablers, combined with our understanding of the Threat Hunting Loop and the Pyramid of Pain, are essential for effective threat hunting."
