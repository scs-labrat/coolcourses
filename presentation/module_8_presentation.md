**Slide 2: Capstone Project Options**

*   **Option 1: Threat Hunting Dashboard:** Visualize security metrics from various sources.
*   **Option 2: Playbook Automation:** Automate steps in a threat hunting playbook (e.g., lateral movement).
*   **Option 3: Threat Hunting Tool:** Develop a tool for a specific hunting task (e.g., DNS tunneling detection).
*   **Option 4: Threat Hunting Report & Presentation:** Analyze a real-world threat, including IoCs and mitigation.
*   **Option 5: Cyber Threat Hunting 101 Teaching Assistant:** Create course content (quizzes, questions, etc.).

**Narration:** "For your capstone project, you have several options to choose from, each allowing you to apply your skills in different ways. You can build a Threat Hunting Dashboard to visualize key security data, automate a Threat Hunting Playbook to streamline specific tasks, create a standalone Threat Hunting Tool for specialized analysis, develop a comprehensive Threat Hunting Report on a real-world threat, or you can work to develop the Cyber Threat Hunting 101 course by developing teaching materials. Choose the option that best aligns with your interests, skills, and available time."

**Slide 3: Phase 1: Planning (Weeks 1-2) - Project Selection & Scope**

*   **Project Selection (Day 1):** Choose a project based on skillset, interest, and time. *Deliverable:* Project description.
*   **Scope Definition (Day 2-3):** Define specific features and functionality. *Deliverable:* Project Scope Document.
*   **Importance:** This is the foundation of your success.

**Narration:** "The first phase of the project is all about planning. Start by carefully selecting your project, considering your existing skills, interests, and the time you have available. Next, define the scope of your project. Be realistic and specific about what you can achieve within the given timeframe. A well-defined scope is crucial for staying on track and delivering a successful project. A clear scope will help you to avoid scope creep."

**Slide 4: Phase 1: Planning (Weeks 1-2) - Technology & Design**

*   **Technology Stack Selection (Day 4-5):** Choose tools, libraries, and technologies. *Deliverable:* Technology list with rationale.
*   **Design (Day 6-7):** Create a high-level design (mockups, flowcharts). *Deliverable:* Visual project design.
*   **Importance:** Plan for the tools and the user experience.

**Narration:** "Once you've defined the scope, select the specific technologies you'll use. Explain why you're choosing these technologies; for example, their advantages for the task at hand. Then, create a high-level design of your project. This could be a mockup of your dashboard, a flowchart of your script's logic, or an outline of your report. Visualizing your project will help you understand the workflow and ensure that your project is well-structured."

**Slide 5: Phase 1: Planning (Weeks 1-2) - Task Breakdown & Timeline**

*   **Task Breakdown (Week 2):** Break project into smaller, manageable tasks.
*   **Timeline (Week 2):** Estimate time for each task and create a timeline with deadlines.
*   **Deliverable:** Detailed task list and timeline.
*   **Importance:** Stay organized and on schedule.

**Narration:** "The final step in the planning phase is to break down your project into smaller, manageable tasks. Estimate the time required for each task and create a timeline with specific deadlines. This will help you stay organized, track your progress, and ensure that you complete the project on time. Remember to be realistic about your time estimates."

**Slide 6: Phase 2: Implementation (Weeks 3-6) - Core Development**

*   **Setting up the Environment (Week 3):** Install and configure chosen technologies. *Deliverable:* Working development environment.
*   **Data Ingestion (Week 3-4):** Get data flowing into your project. *Deliverable:* Data successfully ingested.
*   **Core Functionality (Week 4-5):** Implement the core functionality. *Deliverable:* Functional (but incomplete) version.

**Narration:** "Phase 2 is where you'll bring your project to life. Start by setting up your development environment and installing the necessary technologies. Next, focus on getting data flowing into your project. This might involve configuring log shippers, writing scripts to parse data, or gathering information from various sources. Finally, implement the core functionality of your project. Don't try to build everything at once; focus on getting the basic functionality working first."

**Slide 7: Phase 2: Implementation (Weeks 3-6) - Enhancements & Code Examples**

*   **Enhancements and Refinements (Week 5-6):** Add features, refine UI, fix bugs, improve performance. *Deliverable:* Polished, functional project.
*   **Example Code:** Python code for Elasticsearch queries, EVTX parsing, and Scapy DNS analysis.

**Narration:** "Once you have the core functionality working, focus on adding enhancements, refining the user interface, fixing bugs, and improving performance. This is where you can really make your project shine. The slide also shows some example code in Python for common threat hunting tasks like querying Elasticsearch, parsing Windows Event Logs, and analyzing DNS traffic using Scapy."

**Slide 8: Phase 3: Testing & Documentation (Week 7)**

*   **Testing:** Thoroughly test your project with test cases. *Deliverable:* Test case list and results.
*   **Documentation:** Write comprehensive documentation (description, installation, usage, architecture). *Deliverable:* Well-written documentation (e.g., README).
*   **Importance:** Ensure quality and usability.

**Narration:** "Testing and documentation are critical for a successful project. Thoroughly test your project with a variety of test cases to ensure that it works correctly and handles different scenarios. Then, write comprehensive documentation that explains how to install, configure, and use your project. Good documentation is essential for making your project usable by others."

*   **Final Thought:** Experiment, learn, and adapt!

**Narration:** "Your project will be graded based on the planning, implementation, testing and documentation, and presentation and peer review. Keep in mind some key considerations: manage your time effectively, avoid scope creep, use version control to track your changes, collaborate effectively if you're working in a team, and don't be afraid to ask for help when you're stuck. Remember, this is an iterative process, so don't be afraid to experiment, learn, and adapt as you go along. Good luck, and I look forward to seeing your amazing projects!"
