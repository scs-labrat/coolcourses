<h1>Capstone Project: Building Your Own Cyber Threat Hunting 101</h1>
<p>Okay, here's a hyper-detailed, step-by-step deep dive into Module 8, "Capstone Project: Building Your Own Cyber Threat Hunting 101," based on the course outline. I'll aim to make this practical, engaging, and reflective of my teaching style, emphasizing open sharing and understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Module 8: Capstone Project: Building Your Own Cyber Threat Hunting 101</strong></p>
<p><strong>Module Objective:</strong> Integrate all learned knowledge and skills to create a functional clone of the course topic.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<p>Congratulations! You've reached the final module. This is where you put everything you've learned into practice. The goal here isn't just to <em>understand</em> threat hunting, but to <em>demonstrate</em> that understanding by building something tangible.  Think of this as not just a project, but a portfolio piece â€“ something you can show off to potential employers or use to further your career. This module also will focus on the best parts of teaching, so that you too will have the skills to teach others about the topic.</p>
<p><strong>Project Options:</strong></p>
<p>Before we dive into the steps, let's clarify the project options. You can choose <em>one</em> of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Threat Hunting Dashboard:</strong>  A web-based dashboard visualizing key security metrics and potential threats, pulling data from various sources (logs, threat intelligence feeds, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Threat Hunting Playbook Automation:</strong> A script (e.g., Python) that automates steps in a specific threat hunting playbook (e.g., detecting lateral movement).</li>
<li><strong>Threat Hunting Tool:</strong>  A command-line or GUI tool that performs a specific threat hunting task (e.g., a tool to identify DNS tunneling).</li>
<li><strong>Threat Hunting Report &amp; Presentation:</strong> A detailed report analyzing a specific real-world threat (e.g., a recent ransomware campaign) and presenting your findings, including indicators of compromise (IoCs) and mitigation strategies. This can be a great option if coding isn't your strongest suit, but you excel at analysis and communication.</li>
<li><strong>Cyber Threat Hunting 101 Teaching Assistant:</strong> A teaching assistant module that would include creating quizzes, grading them, creating new content for the course, or answering student questions.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Guide:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Phase 1: Planning (Weeks 1-2)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Project Selection (Day 1):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Carefully review the project options above.</li>
<li><strong>Considerations:</strong><ul>
<li>Your existing skillset: What are you already good at?</li>
