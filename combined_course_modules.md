I've tried to inject my love for teaching and open sharing into the structure, making it engaging and accessible. Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific module or aspect of the course!

## File 2: module_1.md

Okay, let's dive into Module 1: "The Need for Proactive Security" with a hyper-detailed, step-by-step approach, designed to be engaging and practical.

**Module 1: The Need for Proactive Security**

**Module Objective:** Understand the limitations of reactive security and the rationale for adopting a proactive threat hunting approach.

**1.1 The Swiss Cheese Model in Cybersecurity: Understanding Layered Defenses and Their Inherent Gaps**

*   **Concept:** Explain the Swiss Cheese Model.  Imagine multiple slices of Swiss cheese stacked together. Each slice represents a security control or layer.  Each slice has holes. If the holes align across all slices, a threat can pass through.
*   **Why it matters:** No single security control is perfect.  Even with multiple layers, vulnerabilities exist.  Reactive security relies on these layers *working perfectly*, which they rarely do.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Layer 1: Firewall:** Might block common port scans but miss sophisticated evasion techniques.
    *   **Layer 2: Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** Might detect known malware signatures but fail to identify zero-day exploits or custom malware.
    *   **Layer 3: Antivirus Software:**  Might catch some malware but be bypassed by fileless attacks or polymorphic malware.
*   **Practical Illustration:** Draw (or find a diagram online) of the Swiss Cheese Model.  Annotate it with example security controls and potential weaknesses.

**1.2 The Concept of "Scope X" (Unknown Unknowns) and its Impact on Security Posture**

*   **Concept:** "Scope X" refers to the things you *don't know that you don't know.*  These are the blind spots in your security visibility.  They represent vulnerabilities, attack vectors, or threats you haven't even considered.
*   **Why it matters:** Reactive security is inherently limited by what you *already know*.  You can't defend against what you can't see.  Scope X is where the most dangerous and successful attacks originate.
*   **Examples:**
    *   A zero-day vulnerability in a widely used library.
    *   A misconfiguration in a cloud environment that exposes sensitive data.
    *   A sophisticated supply chain attack that compromises trusted software.
*   **Practical Illustration:** Think of a dark room.  You can only react to what you can see with a flashlight (your known security measures). Scope X is everything in the darkness beyond the flashlight's beam.

**1.3 The "Security, Usability, and Cost" Triangle: Balancing Trade-offs in Security Implementations**

*   **Concept:** Security, usability, and cost are often competing factors.  Increasing one can negatively impact the others.  For example, implementing very strict security policies might make systems difficult to use and require expensive resources to maintain.
*   **Why it matters:** Effective security requires finding the right balance.  It's not about achieving 100% security (which is impossible) but about mitigating risk to an acceptable level while maintaining usability and cost-effectiveness.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **High Security, Low Usability, High Cost:** Multi-factor authentication (MFA) with complex passwords and biometric verification.  Highly secure, but potentially inconvenient and expensive to implement and manage.
    *   **Low Security, High Usability, Low Cost:**  Simple password policies and minimal security controls.  Easy to use and inexpensive, but highly vulnerable to attacks.
*   **Practical Illustration:** Draw a triangle with Security, Usability, and Cost at each vertex.  Explain how moving closer to one vertex pulls you further away from the others.

**1.4 Reactive vs. Proactive Security: Comparing and Contrasting Approaches**

*   **Reactive Security:**
    *   **Definition:** Responding to security incidents *after* they occur.
    *   **Focus:** Detection, containment, and remediation.
    *   **Tools:** Firewalls, IDS/IPS, antivirus software, SIEM.
    *   **Limitations:**  Limited visibility into unknown threats, reliance on pre-defined signatures and rules, slow response times.
    *   **Analogy:**  The ambulance waiting for an accident to happen.
*   **Proactive Security:**
    *   **Definition:**  Identifying and mitigating security risks *before* they are exploited.
    *   **Focus:** Prevention, detection of anomalies, and hunting for threats.
    *   **Tools:** Vulnerability scanners, penetration testing tools, threat intelligence platforms, endpoint detection and response (EDR), user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA).
    *   **Limitations:**  Requires specialized skills and resources, can generate false positives, may not be able to prevent all attacks.
    *   **Analogy:**  The safety inspector proactively identifying and fixing hazards.
*   **Comparison Table:**
    | Feature       | Reactive Security        | Proactive Security           |
    |---------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
    | **Focus**     | Response               | Prevention & Hunting        |
    | **Timing**    | After incident          | Before incident            |
    | **Visibility**| Known threats           | Unknown & Emerging threats |
    | **Approach**  | Rule-based, Signature  | Anomaly-based, Heuristic   |
*   **Code example (Python - simple log parsing for reactive detection):**

    ```python
    import re

    def detect_failed_login(log_file):
        """
        Parses a log file and detects failed login attempts based on a regex.
        This is a basic example of REACTION to a log event.
        """
        failed_login_pattern = re.compile(r"Failed login for user .* from .*")
        with open(log_file, 'r') as f:
            for line in f:
                if failed_login_pattern.search(line):
                    print(f"ALERT: Possible brute-force attack detected in line: {line.strip()}")

    # Example usage:
    detect_failed_login("auth.log")  # Replace with your actual log file
    ```

**1.5 A Brief Overview of Proactive Cybersecurity Methods**

*   **Vulnerability Assessments:** Identifying known vulnerabilities in systems and applications.
*   **Penetration Testing (Ethical Hacking):** Simulating real-world attacks to identify security weaknesses.
*   **Red Teaming:**  A more comprehensive and realistic simulation of an advanced persistent threat (APT).
*   **Bug Bounties:**  Offering rewards to external researchers for finding and reporting vulnerabilities.
*   **Threat Hunting:**  Proactively searching for malicious activity that has bypassed existing security controls.
*   **User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA):**  Analyzing user and system behavior to detect anomalies that may indicate malicious activity.
*   **Threat Intelligence:**  Gathering and analyzing information about threats and threat actors to improve security posture.

**1.6 Why Threat Hunting is Crucial in a Modern Threat Landscape**

*   **Advanced Threats:** Modern attacks are increasingly sophisticated and can evade traditional security controls.
*   **Evolving Attack Surfaces:**  The attack surface is constantly expanding with the adoption of cloud computing, IoT devices, and mobile devices.
*   **Insider Threats:** Malicious or negligent insiders can pose a significant risk.
*   **Zero-Day Exploits:**  Attacks that exploit vulnerabilities before they are known to the vendor.
*   **Compliance Requirements:** Many regulations require organizations to implement proactive security measures.
*   **Proactive Approach:** Threat hunting provides a proactive approach to security, allowing organizations to identify and mitigate threats before they cause damage.

**1.7 The Importance of a Holistic Approach: People, Processes, and Technology**

*   **People:** Skilled security professionals are essential for effective threat hunting.  This includes training, awareness programs, and a strong security culture.
*   **Processes:** Well-defined processes are needed for threat hunting, incident response, and vulnerability management. This includes clear roles and responsibilities, escalation procedures, and communication plans.
*   **Technology:** The right tools and technologies are needed to collect, analyze, and visualize security data. This includes SIEM systems, EDR solutions, threat intelligence platforms, and network traffic analysis tools.
*   **Interdependence:** These three elements are interdependent.  Even the best technology is useless without skilled people and well-defined processes.

**1.8 Case Study: A Major Breach that Could Have Been Prevented by Threat Hunting**

*   **Choose a well-documented breach:** (e.g., Target, Equifax, SolarWinds).
*   **Analyze the attack:**
    *   How did the attackers gain access?
    *   What vulnerabilities did they exploit?
    *   What indicators of compromise (IoCs) were present?
    *   How long did the attackers remain undetected?
*   **Explain how threat hunting could have prevented the breach:**
    *   What proactive measures could have been taken to identify the attackers earlier?
    *   What data sources could have been used to detect the attack?
    *   What threat hunting scenarios could have been developed to identify the attackers' TTPs?

**Module 1: Suggested Resources/Prerequisites:**

*   **Read articles on the Swiss Cheese Model in cybersecurity:** Search for "Swiss Cheese Model Cybersecurity" on Google Scholar or security blogs.
*   **Research examples of major breaches caused by unknown vulnerabilities:**  Read security reports from Verizon, Mandiant, CrowdStrike, etc.
*   **Review the basics of common defensive cybersecurity tools (firewalls, IDS/IPS):**  Online documentation, vendor websites.

**Module 1: Module Project/Exercise:**

*   **Gap Analysis:**
    *   **Scenario:**  A small law firm with 50 employees, a Windows-based network, and basic firewall and antivirus protection.  They handle sensitive client data.
    *   **Task:** Identify potential gaps in their reactive defenses based on the Swiss Cheese Model.  Propose proactive measures to address these gaps.  (e.g., "The firewall might not detect data exfiltration over encrypted channels.  Implement network traffic analysis to identify anomalous traffic patterns.")
*   **Capstone Project Contribution:**
    *   Write a brief section (1-2 paragraphs) for your final report describing the limitations of reactive security and the need for threat hunting.  Emphasize Scope X and the Security, Usability, and Cost trade-offs.

This detailed breakdown provides a solid foundation for understanding the need for proactive security and sets the stage for the rest of the course. Each section includes clear explanations, practical examples, and hands-on exercises. This way, students learn not just the theory but also the practical implications.

## File 3: module_2.md

**Subtopics:**

*   Defining Cyber Threat Hunting: A clear definition and scope.
*   Core Principles of Threat Hunting:
    *   Understanding historical threats.
    *   Analyzing current threats.
    *   Predicting potential future threats.

---

**1. Defining Cyber Threat Hunting: A Clear Definition and Scope**

*   **Explanation:** Cyber threat hunting is a *proactive* security activity that involves actively searching for threats that have evaded existing security controls.  It's not just about responding to alerts; it's about *actively seeking out* malicious activity that might otherwise go unnoticed. It is an iterative process.

*   **Key Characteristics:**

    *   **Proactive:** Initiated by the hunter, not by an alert.
    *   **Hypothesis-Driven:** Starts with a question or suspicion.
    *   **Iterative:** Refines the hunt based on findings.
    *   **Human-Led:** Relies on the skills and intuition of the hunter.
    *   **Data-Driven:** Leverages data from various sources.
*   **Scope:** Threat hunting can encompass various areas, including:
    *   **Network:** Analyzing network traffic for anomalies.
    *   **Endpoints:** Examining endpoint behavior for suspicious activity.
    *   **Logs:** Searching logs for indicators of compromise.
    *   **Cloud:** Investigating cloud infrastructure for security threats.
*   **Contrast with Incident Response:** Incident response is *reactive*. It's triggered by an alert or incident. Threat hunting is *proactive* and seeks to identify threats *before* they cause damage or trigger alerts.

**2. Core Principles of Threat Hunting**

*   **Explanation:**  Effective threat hunting requires understanding the threat landscape, both past, present, and potential future threats.

    *   **Understanding Historical Threats:**
        *   **Why:**  Knowing past attacks helps identify patterns and anticipate future attacks.
        *   **How:** Review historical security reports, incident reports, and threat intelligence.
        *   **Example:** If you know that a particular ransomware group targeted your industry last year, you can proactively hunt for their specific tactics and tools in your network.
    *   **Analyzing Current Threats:**
        *   **Why:** Staying up-to-date on current threats allows you to hunt for the latest malware, exploits, and attack techniques.
        *   **How:** Monitor threat intelligence feeds, security blogs, and vulnerability databases.
        *   **Example:** If a new zero-day vulnerability is announced, you can immediately hunt for exploitation attempts in your environment.
    *   **Predicting Potential Future Threats:**
        *   **Why:**  Anticipating future attacks allows you to prepare your defenses and proactively hunt for vulnerabilities.
        *   **How:**  Analyze trends in the threat landscape, conduct threat modeling, and monitor emerging technologies.
        *   **Example:** If you see a growing trend of attacks targeting cloud infrastructure, you can proactively hunt for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in your cloud environment.

**3. The Threat Hunting Loop: Plan, Hunt, Analyze, Report, Improve**

*   **Explanation:** The threat hunting loop is an iterative process that guides the threat hunting activity.
*   **Steps:**

    1.  **Plan:**
        *   **Define the scope:** What are you trying to find?
        *   **Formulate a hypothesis:** What do you suspect is happening?  (e.g., "A user's machine is beaconing to a known command-and-control server.")
        *   **Identify data sources:** Where will you look for evidence? (e.g., firewall logs, endpoint logs, network traffic).
        *   **Select tools:** What tools will you use to analyze the data? (e.g., Wireshark, Splunk, PowerShell).
    2.  **Hunt:**
        *   **Collect data:** Gather the relevant data from your chosen sources.
        *   **Analyze data:** Use your selected tools to analyze the data for evidence of your hypothesis.
    3.  **Analyze:**
        *   **Evaluate findings:** Did you find evidence to support your hypothesis?
        *   **Investigate further:** If you found something suspicious, investigate further to determine the impact and scope.
        *   **Refine your hypothesis:** Based on your findings, refine your hypothesis and continue hunting.
    4.  **Report:**
        *   **Document your findings:** Create a detailed report of your findings, including the evidence you found, the impact of the threat, and any actions taken.
        *   **Share your findings:** Share your findings with other security teams and stakeholders.
    5.  **Improve:**
        *   **Review your process:** What worked well? What could be improved?
        *   **Update your security controls:** Based on your findings, update your security controls to prevent future attacks.
        *   **Share lessons learned:** Share your lessons learned with other security teams and stakeholders.
*   **Example:**

    *   **Plan:** Hypothesis: "A new phishing campaign is targeting our users." Data sources: Email gateway logs, endpoint logs. Tools: Splunk, PowerShell.
    *   **Hunt:** Collect email gateway logs and endpoint logs. Analyze the logs for suspicious email attachments or links.
    *   **Analyze:** Found several users who clicked on a malicious link. The link downloaded a malware payload.
    *   **Report:** Documented the phishing campaign, the malware payload, and the affected users. Shared the findings with the incident response team.
    *   **Improve:** Updated email gateway filters to block the malicious links. Trained users on how to identify phishing emails.

**4. The Pyramid of Pain: Categorizing Indicators and Observables (IoCs) to Maximize Impact**

*   **Explanation:** The Pyramid of Pain, developed by David Bianco, is a framework for categorizing indicators of compromise (IoCs) based on how much effort it takes for an attacker to change them. The higher up the pyramid you go, the more difficult and costly it is for the attacker to adapt.  The goal is to focus on indicators that cause the most pain for the attacker.
*   **Levels (from bottom to top):**

    1.  **Hash Values:** (MD5, SHA1, SHA256)  Easiest for attackers to change.
    2.  **IP Addresses:** Relatively easy for attackers to change (using new servers, VPNs, etc.).
    3.  **Domain Names:**  More difficult than IP addresses, but still relatively easy to change (registering new domains).
    4.  **Network/Host Artifacts:**  (e.g., specific registry keys, file paths, user-agent strings)  Requires more effort to change.
    5.  **Tools:** (e.g., specific malware families, exploit kits)  Requires significant effort to change (developing new tools).
    6.  **TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures):**  The hardest for attackers to change. These are the *way* they operate. Changing TTPs requires a fundamental shift in their approach.
*   **Practical Application:**

    *   Focus your threat hunting efforts on the higher levels of the pyramid.
    *   If you find a malicious IP address, that's good, but it's relatively easy for the attacker to change.
    *   If you identify the TTPs used by an attacker, you can proactively hunt for other attacks that use the same TTPs.
*   **Example:**

    *   You identify a piece of malware using a specific user-agent string in its HTTP requests (Network/Host Artifact).  You can then proactively hunt for other systems in your network using the same user-agent string.
    *   You observe an attacker using PowerShell to download and execute malicious code (TTP). You can then proactively monitor PowerShell activity for similar patterns.

**5. Key Enablers for Successful Threat Hunting**

*   **Explanation:**  Effective threat hunting requires the right tools, data, and context.
    *   **Total Visibility: Access to Relevant Data Sources:**
        *   **Why:** You can't hunt for what you can't see.
        *   **Data Sources:**

*   **Example: Strings Analysis on Linux:**

    ```bash
    strings malware.exe | grep -E "http|www\.|.com|.exe|.dll|C:\\|HKEY_"
    ```

    This command extracts all strings from the `malware.exe` file and filters them for common indicators of compromise, such as URLs, domain names, file extensions, file paths, and registry keys.

*   **Important Note:**  Handle malware with extreme caution. Always analyze malware in a sandboxed environment to prevent infection of your own system.

**3.1.4 Log Analysis: Interpreting Security Logs from Various Sources**

*   **Why it's important:** Logs are a record of system activity. By analyzing logs, you can identify suspicious events, track user activity, and reconstruct attack sequences.

    ```powershell
    Get-WinEvent -LogName Security -MaxEvents 100 | Where-Object {$_.ID -eq 4624} | Format-List
    ```

    This command retrieves the 100 most recent events from the Security log, filters for events with ID 4624 (successful logon), and displays the results in a list format.

*   **Example: Analyzing Apache Web Server Logs with grep (Linux):**

    ```bash
    grep "404" /var/log/apache2/access.log
    ```

    This command searches the Apache access log for lines containing "404" (not found errors), which could indicate web application scanning or directory traversal attempts.

    *   **Tell a story:** Use your visualizations to tell a story about the data.

**3.2.2 Analytical Thinking: Developing Hypotheses and Testing Them Against Data**

*   **Why it's important:** Threat hunting is an iterative process of developing hypotheses and testing them against data.  Analytical thinking is the key to formulating effective hypotheses and interpreting the results.

*   **Deep Dive:**

    *   **The Scientific Method:**
        1.  **Observation:** Observe something unusual or suspicious in your data.
        2.  **Hypothesis:** Formulate a hypothesis about the cause of the observation.
        3.  **Prediction:** Make a prediction based on your hypothesis.
        4.  **Experiment:** Design and conduct an experiment to test your prediction.
        5.  **Analysis:** Analyze the results of your experiment.
        6.  **Conclusion:** Draw a conclusion about whether your hypothesis is supported by the data.
    *   **Example:**
        1.  **Observation:** You notice a spike in network traffic to a specific IP address.
        2.  **Hypothesis:** The spike in network traffic is caused by malware communicating with a command-and-control server.

        *   `protocol`: Network protocol (e.g., `tcp`, `udp`, `icmp`, `ip`).
        *   `src_ip`: Source IP address.
        *   `src_port`: Source port.
        *   `->`: Direction of traffic.
        *   `dest_ip`: Destination IP address.
        *   `dest_port`: Destination port.
    *   **Options:** Keywords that specify additional criteria for matching traffic.
        *   `msg`: Alert message.
        *   `content`: Matches specific content within the packet.
        *   `sid`: Snort ID (unique identifier for the rule).

        ```
        alert icmp any any -> any any (msg:"ICMP Traffic Detected"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)
        ```

    *   **Detecting HTTP traffic containing the string "malware.exe":**

        ```
        alert tcp any any -> any 80 (msg:"HTTP Traffic with malware.exe"; content:"malware.exe"; http_uri; sid:1000002; rev:1;)
        ```

    *   **Detecting a specific User-Agent:**

        ```
        alert tcp any any -> any 80 (msg:"Suspicious User-Agent"; content:"BadBot/1.0"; http_header; sid:1000003; rev:1;)
        ```

*   **Testing Snort/Suricata Rules:**

    1.  Create a rule file (e.g., `local.rules`) in the rules directory (`/etc/snort/rules` or `/etc/suricata/rules`).
    2.  Add your rules to the file.
    3.  Run Snort/Suricata in test mode:

        *   **Suricata:** `sudo suricata -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml -T -i eth0`

    4.  Generate traffic that matches your rule (e.g., using `curl` or `ping`).
    5.  Verify that Snort/Suricata generates an alert.

*   **Running Snort/Suricata in Production Mode:**

    *   **Snort:** `sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0 -A console` (outputs alerts to the console)
    *   **Suricata:** `sudo suricata -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml -i eth0` (logs alerts to a file)

*   **Analyzing Snort/Suricata Alerts:**

    *   Alerts are typically logged to a file (e.g., `/var/log/snort/alert` or `/var/log/suricata/fast.log`).
    *   Alerts contain information about the event, including:
        *   Timestamp
        *   Source and destination IP addresses and ports
        *   Rule ID
        *   Alert message
        *   Packet data (optional)
    *   Use tools like `grep`, `awk`, or specialized SIEM solutions to analyze alerts.

*   **Hands-on Exercise:**

    1.  Install Snort/Suricata on your Kali Linux VM.
    2.  Create a custom rule to detect a specific type of traffic (e.g., traffic to a known malicious IP address).
    3.  Test the rule by generating the traffic and verifying that Snort/Suricata generates an alert.
    4.  Analyze the alert and extract relevant information.

        *   Example: `tcp port 80` (captures only HTTP traffic).
        *   Example: `host 192.168.1.100` (captures traffic to/from the IP address 192.168.1.100).
    *   **Display Filters:** Filter traffic *after* it has been captured. More flexible than capture filters.
        *   Example: `http.request.method == "GET"` (displays only HTTP GET requests).
        *   Example: `ip.src == 10.0.0.1 && tcp.port == 443` (displays TCP traffic from 10.0.0.1 to port 443).
        *   Example: `http contains "password"` (displays HTTP traffic containing the string "password").
        *   Example: `tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0` (displays TCP SYN packets).

*   **Analyzing Network Traffic with Wireshark:**

    *   **Following TCP Streams:** Allows you to view the entire conversation between two hosts.
        *   Right-click on a packet and select "Follow" -> "TCP Stream".
    *   **Examining Protocol Headers:** Provides information about the protocol being used, source and destination addresses, and other relevant details.
    *   **Extracting Files:** Allows you to extract files that have been transmitted over the network (e.g., images, documents, executables).
        *   "File" -> "Export Objects" -> "HTTP".
    *   **Statistical Analysis:** Wireshark provides various statistical tools for analyzing network traffic.
        *   "Statistics" -> "Summary"
        *   "Statistics" -> "Conversations"
        *   "Statistics" -> "Endpoints"

*   **Wireshark for Threat Hunting (Examples):**

    *   **Detecting C&C Traffic:** Look for unusual connection patterns, long-lived connections, or traffic to known malicious IP addresses or domains.
    *   **Identifying Data Exfiltration:** Look for large amounts of data being transferred to external hosts, or traffic to unusual ports or protocols.
    *   **Detecting Malware Infections:** Look for suspicious DNS queries, HTTP requests to malicious websites, or traffic containing malware signatures.
    *   **Analyzing Encrypted Traffic (HTTPS):** While you can't see the content, you can still analyze the TLS/SSL handshake to identify potential issues.

*   **Hands-on Exercise:**

    1.  Capture network traffic while browsing a website or using a specific application.
    2.  Use Wireshark filters to isolate specific types of traffic.

**5. NetFlow Analysis (1 hour)**

*   **Introduction to NetFlow:**

    *   A network protocol developed by Cisco for collecting network flow data.
    *   Provides information about network traffic flows, including:
        *   Source and destination IP addresses and ports.
        *   Protocol.
        *   Number of packets and bytes transferred.
        *   Start and end times.
    *   Less detailed than packet captures, but more scalable and efficient for large networks.

*   **NetFlow vs. Packet Capture:**

    | Feature          | NetFlow                  | Packet Capture              |
    | ---------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
    | Data Captured    | Flow information         | Full packet content        |
    | Scalability      | High                     | Low                         |
    | Storage Required | Low                      | High                        |
    | Processing Power | Low                      | High                        |
    | Detail           | Less detailed            | Very detailed              |

*   **NetFlow Architecture:**

    *   **NetFlow Exporter:** A device (e.g., router, switch, firewall) that generates NetFlow data.
    *   **NetFlow Collector:** A server that receives and stores NetFlow data.
    *   **NetFlow Analyzer:** A tool that analyzes NetFlow data to identify trends, anomalies, and security threats.

**1. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Solutions**

*   **Overview of EDR Capabilities:**

    *   **What is EDR?**  EDR solutions are advanced security tools designed to detect and respond to threats on endpoints. They go beyond traditional antivirus by providing real-time monitoring, behavioral analysis, and automated response capabilities.
    *   **Key Features:**
        *   **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuously monitors endpoint activity (processes, network connections, file changes, registry modifications).
        *   **Behavioral Analysis:**  Identifies suspicious behavior based on predefined rules and machine learning algorithms.  This helps detect anomalies that traditional signature-based AV might miss.
        *   **Threat Intelligence Integration:** Correlates endpoint activity with known threat intelligence to identify potential threats.
        *   **Automated Response:**  Automatically isolates infected endpoints, terminates malicious processes, and removes malicious files.
        *   **Forensic Analysis:**  Provides tools for investigating security incidents and understanding the root cause of attacks.
        *   **Endpoint Isolation:** Ability to quickly isolate a compromised endpoint from the network to prevent further spread.
    *   **Popular EDR Solutions:** CrowdStrike Falcon, SentinelOne, Carbon Black, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.  (Note: Access to a full EDR solution requires licensing. We'll focus on techniques applicable even without a full EDR deployment.)

*   **Using EDR Tools for Threat Hunting:**

    *   **Searching for Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**  EDR tools allow you to search for specific IoCs (IP addresses, domain names, file hashes, registry keys) across all endpoints.
    *   **Behavioral Hunting:**  Identify suspicious behavior by searching for specific events or sequences of events.  For example, you might look for processes that are creating child processes with suspicious names or network connections.
    *   **Threat Intelligence Integration:**  Leverage the EDR's threat intelligence feeds to identify potential threats that are targeting your organization.
    *   **Example Scenarios:**
        *   **Hunting for Lateral Movement:** Look for processes that are accessing network shares or attempting to authenticate to other systems.
        *   **Hunting for Malware Execution:**  Look for processes that are creating or modifying files in suspicious locations (e.g., the Startup folder) or that are injecting code into other processes.
        *   **Hunting for Command and Control (C2) Activity:**  Look for processes that are communicating with known C2 servers.
    *   **Limitations:**  EDR solutions can be expensive and require significant expertise to configure and manage. They also rely on accurate threat intelligence and behavioral analysis rules.

**2. Sysmon**

*   **Configuring Sysmon for Detailed Logging:**

    *   **What is Sysmon?** Sysmon (System Monitor) is a free Windows system service that logs detailed information about system activity to the Windows Event Log.  It's a powerful tool for threat hunting and incident response.

        *   **Detecting Malware Persistence:**  Look for processes that are creating or modifying registry keys in the `Run` or `RunOnce` keys.

**3. Windows Event Logs**

*   **Understanding Windows Event Log Structure:**

    *   **What are Windows Event Logs?** Windows Event Logs are a record of system events, including application errors, security events, and system events. They are a valuable source of information for troubleshooting, auditing, and security monitoring.
    *   **Key Event Logs:**
        *   **Application:**  Logs events related to applications.
        *   **Security:**  Logs security-related events, such as logon attempts, account management events, and object access events.  This is the *most* relevant log for threat hunting.
        *   **System:**  Logs events related to the operating system.
    *   **Event Log Structure:** Each event log entry contains the following information:
        *   **Event ID:**  A unique identifier for the event.
        *   **Source:**  The component that generated the event.
        *   **Time Generated:**  The date and time when the event occurred.
        *   **User:**  The user account that was associated with the event.
        *   **Computer:**  The computer on which the event occurred.
        *   **Description:**  A detailed description of the event.
        *   **EventData:**  Structured data associated with the event (e.g., user account names, file paths, IP addresses).

*   **Using PowerShell for Event Log Analysis:**

    *   **`Get-WinEvent` Cmdlet:**  The `Get-WinEvent` cmdlet is used to query Windows Event Logs.

    *   **Example: Get Security Events:**

    ```powershell
    Get-WinEvent -LogName Security -MaxEvents 10
    ```

    *   **Example: Filter by Event ID:**

    ```powershell
    Get-WinEvent -LogName Security -FilterXPath "//Event[System[EventID=4624]]" -MaxEvents 10
    ```

    *   **Explanation:**
        *   `-LogName`: Specifies the name of the event log to query.
        *   `-FilterXPath`: Specifies an XPath query to filter the events.
        *   `//Event[System[EventID=4624]]`:  An XPath query that selects all events with Event ID 4624 (an account successfully logged on).
        *   `-MaxEvents`: Specifies the maximum number of events to retrieve.

    *   **Example: Extract Specific Data:**

    ```powershell
    Get-WinEvent -LogName Security -FilterXPath "//Event[System[EventID=4624]]" -MaxEvents 10 | ForEach-Object {
        [PSCustomObject]@{
            TimeCreated = $_.TimeCreated
            AccountName = $_.Properties[5].Value
            SourceNetworkAddress = $_.Properties[8].Value
        }
    }
    ```

    *   **Explanation:**
        *   `ForEach-Object`: Iterates over each event.
        *   `[PSCustomObject]`:  Creates a custom object with the specified properties.
        *   `$_.TimeCreated`:  Gets the time the event was created.
        *   `$_.Properties[5].Value`:  Gets the value of the 6th property (Account Name).  **Important:** The property index may vary depending on the Event ID.  Inspect the raw event data to determine the correct index.
        *   `$_.Properties[8].Value`: Gets the value of the 9th property (Source Network Address).

    *   **Common Event IDs for Threat Hunting:**
        *   **4624:**  An account was successfully logged on. (Success Audit)
        *   **4625:**  An account failed to log on. (Failure Audit)  Monitor for repeated failed logon attempts, which could indicate a brute-force attack.
        *   **4672:**  Special privileges assigned to new logon. (Success Audit)
        *   **4688:**  A new process has been created. (Success Audit)  (Similar to Sysmon's Event ID 1, but less detailed).
        *   **4776:**  The domain controller attempted to validate the credentials for an account. (Success Audit) (Kerberos authentication).
        *   **4769:**  A Kerberos service ticket was requested. (Success Audit)

    *   **Example Threat Hunting Scenarios:**

        *   **Detecting Brute-Force Attacks:**  Look for a large number of failed logon attempts (Event ID 4625) from the same source IP address.
        *   **Detecting Lateral Movement:**  Look for successful logon events (Event ID 4624) where the logon type is "Network" (LogonType = 3) and the source IP address is different from the user's usual IP address.
        *   **Detecting Account Impersonation:**  Look for successful logon events (Event ID 4624) where the "Logon ID" is the same as a previous failed logon event (Event ID 4625).

**4. Linux Audit Logs**

*   **Configuring `auditd`:**

    *   **What is `auditd`?**  `auditd` (Audit Daemon) is a Linux subsystem that logs system calls and other security-related events.  It's the primary source of audit information on Linux systems.
    *   **Installation:**  `auditd` is usually installed by default on most Linux distributions. If not, install it using your distribution's package manager (e.g., `apt-get install auditd` on Debian/Ubuntu, `yum install auditd` on CentOS/RHEL).
    *   **Configuration File:** The main configuration file for `auditd` is `/etc/audit/auditd.conf`.
    *   **Audit Rules:**  Audit rules are defined in `/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules` (or similar location, depending on the distribution).  These rules specify which events to log and how to filter them.
    *   **Basic Audit Rule Syntax:**

    ```
    -w <path> -p <permissions> -k <key>
    ```

    *   `-w <path>`:  Specifies the path to the file or directory to monitor.
    *   `-p <permissions>`:  Specifies the permissions to monitor (e.g., `r` for read, `w` for write, `x` for execute, `a` for attribute changes).
    *   `-k <key>`:  Specifies a keyword to associate with the rule.  This makes it easier to filter audit logs.

    *   **Example: Monitor `/etc/passwd` for Write Access:**

    ```
    -w /etc/passwd -p wa -k passwd_changes
    ```

    *   **Example: Monitor Executions of `ssh`:**

    ```
    -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -F path=/usr/bin/ssh -k ssh_exec
    ```

    *   **Explanation:**
        *   `-a always,exit`:  Log the event on every execution and on exit.
        *   `-F arch=b64`:  Specifies the architecture (64-bit).
        *   `-S execve`:  Specifies the system call (execve is used to execute programs).
        *   `-F path=/usr/bin/ssh`:  Specifies the path to the executable.
        *   `-k ssh_exec`:  Specifies the keyword.

    *   **Reloading Audit Rules:** After modifying the audit rules, reload them using the following command:

    ```
    auditctl -R /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules
    ```

*   **Analyzing Audit Logs for Suspicious Activity:**

    *   **Location of Audit Logs:**  Audit logs are typically stored in `/var/log/audit/audit.log`.
    *   **`ausearch` Utility:** The `ausearch` utility is used to query and analyze audit logs.
    *   **Example: Search for Events with a Specific Keyword:**

    ```
    ausearch -k passwd_changes
    ```

    *   **Example: Search for Failed Login Attempts:**

    ```
    ausearch -m auid!=4294967295 -m user_login,user_auth,user_acct -sc auth
    ```

    *   **Example: Search for Executions of `ssh`:**

    ```
    ausearch -k ssh_exec
    ```

    *   **Example Threat Hunting Scenarios:**

        *   **Detecting Unauthorized File Modifications:**  Look for events that indicate that a critical system file (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`) has been modified.
        *   **Detecting Suspicious Process Executions:**  Look for events that indicate that a suspicious process has been executed (e.g., a process that is not normally run by a particular user).
        *   **Detecting Privilege Escalation Attempts:**  Look for events that indicate that a user has attempted to use the `sudo` command or has changed their user ID.
        *   **Detecting SSH Brute-Force Attacks:**  Analyze the logs for failed SSH login attempts.

**5. SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) Systems**

*   **Overview of SIEM Architecture:**

    *   **What is a SIEM?**  A SIEM system is a centralized platform for collecting, analyzing, and managing security logs and events from various sources across an organization.  It provides real-time threat detection, incident response, and compliance reporting.

    *   **Steps:**
        1.  **Examine Sysmon Event ID 1 (Process Create):**  Look for processes that are being created from unusual locations (e.g., the Temp folder) or that have suspicious names.
        2.  **Examine Sysmon Event ID 7 (Image Load):** Look for processes loading DLLs from unusual locations.
        3.  **Examine Sysmon Event ID 3 (Network Connection):**  Look for processes that are making network connections to suspicious IP addresses or domain names.
        4.  **Correlate Events:**  Correlate events to identify patterns of activity that may indicate malware execution. For example, look for a process that is created from the Temp folder, loads a DLL from a suspicious location, and then makes a network connection to a known C2 server.
        5.  **Investigate:** If you find suspicious activity, investigate the process further to determine if it is malicious. You can use tools like VirusTotal to check the file hash of the process.

*   **Using PowerShell to Query Windows Event Logs:**

    *   **Scenario:** You want to identify all users who have logged in to a specific computer in the last 24 hours.
    *   **Steps:**

        ```powershell
        $StartTime = (Get-Date).AddDays(-1)
        Get-WinEvent -LogName Security -FilterXPath "//Event[System[EventID=4624 and TimeCreated >= '$($StartTime.ToString('yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss'))']]" | ForEach-Object {
            [PSCustomObject]@{
                TimeCreated = $_.TimeCreated
                AccountName = $_.Properties[5].Value
            }
        }
        ```

    *   **Explanation:**
        1.  `$StartTime = (Get-Date).AddDays(-1)`:  Calculates the start time (24 hours ago).
        2.  `Get-WinEvent -LogName Security -FilterXPath "//Event[System[EventID=4624 and TimeCreated >= '$($StartTime.ToString('yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss'))']]"`:  Queries the Security event log for successful logon events (Event ID 4624) that occurred within the last 24 hours.  The `TimeCreated` comparison in the XPath query is crucial for filtering by time.
        3.  `ForEach-Object { ... }`: Iterates through the results and creates a custom object for each event, displaying the TimeCreated and AccountName.

## File 7: module_6.md

Okay, let's dive deep into Module 6: Data Analysis Techniques for Threat Hunting. We'll cover each subtopic with detailed explanations, practical examples, and code snippets.

**Module 6: Data Analysis Techniques for Threat Hunting**

**Module Objective:** Master essential data analysis techniques for identifying and understanding threats.

**Introduction:**

Data analysis is the backbone of effective threat hunting. It's about sifting through massive amounts of data to find subtle anomalies that indicate malicious activity. This module will provide you with the tools and techniques to do just that. We'll focus on practical application using common tools and methodologies.  Think of it as learning to "speak data" so you can understand what your logs and network traffic are *really* telling you.

**Subtopic 1: Basic Search and Filtering**

*   **Concept:** The foundation of any analysis is the ability to quickly find relevant data.  Knowing how to efficiently search and filter allows you to narrow down your focus and avoid being overwhelmed by noise.

*   **Explanation:** This involves using search operators (AND, OR, NOT), wildcards, and filters to isolate specific events or patterns within your data.  The specific syntax will vary depending on the tool you're using.

*   **Examples:**

    *   **Linux (Command Line - `grep`):**

        ```bash
        # Find all lines in auth.log containing "failed password"
        grep "failed password" /var/log/auth.log

        # Find all lines containing "failed password" from a specific IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
        grep "failed password" /var/log/auth.log | grep "192.168.1.100"

        # Find all lines containing "failed password" but NOT containing "invalid user"
        grep "failed password" /var/log/auth.log | grep -v "invalid user" # -v inverts the match
        ```

    *   **Windows (PowerShell - `Select-String`):**

        ```powershell
        # Find all lines in the System event log containing "error"
        Get-WinEvent -LogName System | Where-Object {$_.Message -like "*error*"}

        # Find all lines in the System event log containing "error" from a specific source (e.g., "Application Error")
        Get-WinEvent -LogName System | Where-Object {$_.Message -like "*error*" -and $_.ProviderName -like "*Application Error*"}
        ```

    *   **Splunk (SPL):**

        ```splunk
        # Find all events in the "index=main" containing "failed password"
        index=main "failed password"

        # Find all events in the "index=main" containing "failed password" from a specific IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
        index=main "failed password" 192.168.1.100

        #Find all events in the "index=main" containing "failed password" but not "invalid user"
        index=main "failed password" NOT "invalid user"
        ```

    *   **Azure Sentinel (KQL):**

        ```kql
        // Find all events in the SecurityEvent table containing EventID 4625 (failed login)
        SecurityEvent
        | where EventID == 4625

        // Find all events in the SecurityEvent table containing EventID 4625 from a specific source IP (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
        SecurityEvent
        | where EventID == 4625 and IpAddress == "192.168.1.100"

        // Find all events in the SecurityEvent table containing EventID 4625 but not involving a specific user (e.g., "Administrator")
        SecurityEvent
        | where EventID == 4625 and AccountName != "Administrator"
        ```

*   **Key Takeaways:**
    *   Master your tool's specific syntax for search operators and filters.
    *   Use specific keywords and field names to narrow your search.
    *   Don't be afraid to chain multiple filters together to refine your results.

**Subtopic 2: Grouping and Counting**

*   **Concept:**  Grouping and counting allows you to identify patterns and trends by summarizing data.  Instead of looking at individual events, you look at aggregate data to find anomalies.

*   **Explanation:** This involves grouping data based on a specific field (e.g., IP address, user account, event type) and then counting the occurrences within each group.  This can reveal unusual activity that might be missed when looking at individual events.

*   **Examples:**

    *   **Linux (Command Line - `awk` and `sort`):**

        ```bash
        # Count the number of failed login attempts per IP address in auth.log
        awk '/Failed password/ {print $11}' /var/log/auth.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

        # Explanation:
        #   awk '/Failed password/ {print $11}' /var/log/auth.log:  Finds lines containing "Failed password" and prints the 11th field (typically the IP address).
        #   sort: Sorts the IP addresses.
        #   uniq -c: Counts the number of unique occurrences of each IP address.
        #   sort -nr: Sorts the results numerically in reverse order (highest count first).
        ```

    *   **Windows (PowerShell - `Group-Object`):**

        ```powershell
        # Count the number of events per EventID in the System event log
        Get-WinEvent -LogName System | Group-Object -Property ID | Sort-Object -Property Count -Descending
        ```

    *   **Splunk (SPL):**

        ```splunk
        # Count the number of events per source IP address
        index=main | stats count by src_ip

        # Count the number of failed login attempts per user
        index=main "failed password" | stats count by user
        ```

    *   **Azure Sentinel (KQL):**

        ```kql
        // Count the number of events per EventID in the SecurityEvent table
        SecurityEvent
        | summarize count() by EventID
        | order by count_ desc

        // Count the number of failed login attempts per account
        SigninLogs
        | where ResultType == "50057" // Failure code for invalid username
        | summarize count() by UserPrincipalName
        | order by count_ desc
        ```

*   **Key Takeaways:**
    *   Identify fields that are relevant for grouping (e.g., IP address, username, event ID).
    *   Use grouping and counting to find outliers and unusual patterns.
    *   Sort the results to easily identify the most frequent or least frequent occurrences.

**Subtopic 3: Link Analysis**

*   **Concept:**  Link analysis helps visualize relationships between different entities in your data.  This can reveal hidden connections and dependencies that are not immediately obvious.

*   **Explanation:** This involves creating a graph or network diagram where nodes represent entities (e.g., IP addresses, users, files) and edges represent relationships between them (e.g., connection, file access, process execution).

*   **Tools:**

    *   **Maltego:** A powerful commercial tool for link analysis.  It allows you to gather information from various sources and visualize relationships in a graph. (Requires a paid license for full functionality, but a community edition exists with limitations.)
    *   **Neo4j:** A graph database that can be used for storing and analyzing relationships between entities. (Requires some setup and knowledge of the Cypher query language.)
    *   **Open Source Alternatives:**  There are Python libraries like `NetworkX` that can be used for building and visualizing graphs, but they require more coding.

*   **Example (Conceptual - Maltego):**

    1.  **Start with a known IP address (e.g., a suspicious C&C server).**
    2.  **Use Maltego transforms to:**
        *   Find other IP addresses that have communicated with the initial IP.
        *   Identify domain names associated with the IP.
        *   Find email addresses or user accounts that have interacted with those domains.
    3.  **Visualize the relationships:** Maltego will create a graph showing the connections between these entities.  You might discover a cluster of infected hosts communicating with the same C&C server.

*   **Example (Conceptual - Neo4j):**

    1.  **Import your data into Neo4j:** This might involve parsing logs and creating nodes and relationships in the database.  For example:

        ```cypher
        // Create a node for an IP address
        CREATE (ip:IP {address: "192.168.1.100"})

        // Create a node for a user account
        CREATE (user:User {username: "john.doe"})

        // Create a relationship between the IP address and the user (e.g., the user logged in from that IP)
        CREATE (user)-[:LOGGED_IN_FROM]->(ip)
        ```

    2.  **Query the graph to find relationships:**

        ```cypher
        // Find all IP addresses that a specific user has logged in from
        MATCH (user:User {username: "john.doe"})-[:LOGGED_IN_FROM]->(ip:IP)
        RETURN ip.address
        ```

*   **Key Takeaways:**
    *   Link analysis is powerful for uncovering hidden relationships.
    *   Consider using tools like Maltego or Neo4j for more complex analysis.
    *   Start with a known entity (e.g., a suspicious IP) and explore its connections.

**Subtopic 4: Hunting and Query Languages (e.g., KQL in Azure Sentinel, SPL in Splunk)**

*   **Concept:** Learn to write efficient queries to search for specific patterns and anomalies within your data.

*   **Explanation:** Each SIEM or log management platform has its own query language.  Mastering these languages is crucial for effective threat hunting.  We'll focus on KQL (Azure Sentinel) and SPL (Splunk) as examples.

*   **Examples:**

    *   **Splunk (SPL):**

        ```splunk
        # Find all events where a user logged in from a different country than usual
        index=main eventtype=authentication
        | geoip src_ip field=src_ip
        | stats mode(country) as usual_country by user
        | where country != usual_country
        ```

        **Explanation:**

        *   `index=main eventtype=authentication`:  Searches for authentication events in the main index.
        *   `geoip src_ip field=src_ip`:  Adds geographic information based on the source IP address.
        *   `stats mode(country) as usual_country by user`:  Calculates the most frequent country for each user.
        *   `where country != usual_country`:  Filters for events where the current country is different from the user's usual country.

    *   **Azure Sentinel (KQL):**

        ```kql
        // Find all events where a user logged in from a different country than usual
        SigninLogs
        | evaluate bag_unpack(LocationDetails) // Unpack the LocationDetails column
        | summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by UserPrincipalName
        | extend Country = tostring(parse_json(tostring(LocationDetails)).countryOrRegion)
        | summarize make_set(Country) by UserPrincipalName
        | where arraylength(set_Country) > 1
        ```

        **Explanation:**

        *   `SigninLogs`:  Specifies the SigninLogs table.
        *   `evaluate bag_unpack(LocationDetails)`:  Unpacks the JSON in the `LocationDetails` column into individual columns.
        *   `summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by UserPrincipalName`:  Gets the most recent sign-in event for each user.
        *   `extend Country = tostring(parse_json(tostring(LocationDetails)).countryOrRegion)`: Extracts the country from the LocationDetails JSON.
        *   `summarize make_set(Country) by UserPrincipalName`:  Creates a set of countries for each user.
        *   `where arraylength(set_Country) > 1`:  Filters for users who have logged in from more than one country.

*   **Key Takeaways:**
    *   Learn the specific syntax and functions of your chosen query language.
    *   Break down complex queries into smaller, more manageable steps.
    *   Use functions like `geoip`, `stats`, `summarize`, and `where` to filter and aggregate data.

**Subtopic 5: Pattern Matching**

*   **Concept:** Using regular expressions (regex) to identify malicious patterns in your data.

*   **Explanation:** Regular expressions are a powerful way to search for complex patterns in text. They are essential for identifying things like malicious URLs, file paths, or command-line arguments.

*   **Examples:**

    *   **Linux (Command Line - `grep -E`):**

        ```bash
        # Find all URLs in a log file
        grep -E "https?://[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+.[a-zA-Z]{2,}/?" /var/log/apache2/access.log

        #Explanation:
        #   -E: Enables extended regular expressions
        #   https?://: Matches "http://" or "https://"
        #   [a-zA-Z0-9.-]+: Matches one or more alphanumeric characters, dots, or hyphens (the domain name)
        #   .[a-zA-Z]{2,}: Matches a dot followed by a top-level domain (e.g., .com, .org)
        #   /? :  Optionally matches a trailing slash.
        ```

    *   **Windows (PowerShell - `Select-String -Pattern`):**

        ```powershell
        # Find all email addresses in a text file
        Get-Content C:\data\emails.txt | Select-String -Pattern "\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b"
        ```

    *   **Splunk (SPL):**

        ```splunk
        # Find all events containing a suspicious file path (e.g., in the Temp directory)
        index=main | regex _raw="C:\\\\Users\\\\.*\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\.*\.exe"
        ```

    *   **Azure Sentinel (KQL):**

        ```kql
        // Find all events containing a suspicious file path (e.g., in the Temp directory)
        SecurityEvent
        | where CommandLine has regex "C:\\\\Users\\\\.*\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\.*\\.exe"
        ```

*   **Key Takeaways:**
    *   Learn the basics of regular expression syntax (characters, quantifiers, character classes).
    *   Use online regex testers to experiment and refine your patterns.
    *   Start with simple patterns and gradually increase complexity.
    *   Escape special characters properly in your regex.

**Subtopic 6: Timelines**

*   **Concept:** Creating a chronological sequence of events to understand the progression of an attack.

*   **Explanation:**  Timelines help you visualize the order in which events occurred, making it easier to identify the root cause of an incident and understand the attacker's actions.

*   **Tools:**

    *   **Timeline Explorer (Windows):** A free tool from Microsoft for visualizing event logs as timelines.
    *   **Plaso (log2timeline):** A powerful open-source tool for creating timelines from various data sources.
    *   **SIEM Dashboards:** Many SIEMs have built-in timeline visualization capabilities.

*   **Example (Conceptual - Using Timeline Explorer):**

    1.  **Load a Windows Event Log (.evtx file) into Timeline Explorer.**
    2.  **Filter the events to focus on specific Event IDs or keywords (e.g., Event ID 4624 - Successful Logon).**
    3.  **Sort the events by time.**
    4.  **Analyze the sequence of events:** Look for patterns or anomalies, such as:
        *   A series of failed login attempts followed by a successful login.
        *   A user account logging in from multiple locations in a short period of time.
        *   The execution of a suspicious process shortly after a successful login.

*   **Example (Conceptual - Using Plaso):**

    1.  **Run Plaso to create a timeline from multiple data sources (e.g., Windows Event Logs, web server logs, file system metadata):**

        ```bash
        log2timeline.py --storage-file timeline.plaso /path/to/data
        ```

    2.  **Analyze the timeline using psort.py:**

        ```bash
        psort.py -o l2tcsv -w output.csv timeline.plaso
        ```

    3.  **Open the output.csv file in a spreadsheet program and analyze the events by time.**

*   **Key Takeaways:**
    *   Timelines are crucial for understanding the sequence of events in an attack.
    *   Use tools like Timeline Explorer or Plaso to create timelines from various data sources.
    *   Look for patterns and anomalies in the timeline to identify suspicious activity.

**Subtopic 7: Statistical Metrics**

*   **Concept:** Applying statistical analysis to identify anomalies and outliers in your data.

*   **Explanation:**  This involves calculating metrics like averages, standard deviations, and percentiles to identify data points that deviate significantly from the norm.

*   **Examples:**

    *   **Splunk (SPL):**

        ```splunk
        # Calculate the average number of bytes sent per host
        index=main | stats avg(bytes_sent) as avg_bytes by host

        # Identify hosts that sent significantly more bytes than average (e.g., more than 2 standard deviations above the mean)
        index=main | stats avg(bytes_sent) as avg_bytes, stdev(bytes_sent) as stdev_bytes by host
        | where bytes_sent > (avg_bytes + 2*stdev_bytes)
        ```

    *   **Azure Sentinel (KQL):**

        ```kql
        // Calculate the average number of bytes sent per host
        NetworkTraffic
        | summarize avg(Bytes) by SrcIP

        // Identify hosts that sent significantly more bytes than average (e.g., more than 2 standard deviations above the mean)
        let avgBytes = NetworkTraffic | summarize avg(Bytes);
        let stdevBytes = NetworkTraffic | summarize stdev(Bytes);
        NetworkTraffic
        | where Bytes > (tolong(avgBytes) + 2*tolong(stdevBytes))
        ```

*   **Key Takeaways:**
    *   Identify metrics that are relevant to your analysis (e.g., bytes sent, login attempts, CPU usage).
    *   Calculate averages, standard deviations, and other statistical measures.
    *   Use these metrics to identify outliers and anomalies.

**Subtopic 8: Data Aggregation**

*   **Concept:** Combining data from multiple sources to gain a more complete and contextual understanding of an event.

*   **Explanation:**  Threat hunting often requires correlating information from different logs, network traffic, and endpoint data. Data aggregation allows you to bring these disparate sources together to create a more holistic view.

*   **Examples:**

    *   **Scenario:** Investigating a suspicious login event.

    *   **Data Sources:**
        *   Authentication logs (e.g., Windows Event Logs, Linux auth.log)
        *   Network traffic logs (e.g., NetFlow, Zeek logs)
        *   Endpoint logs (e.g., Sysmon logs)

    *   **Aggregation Steps:**

        1.  **Identify the user account and timestamp of the suspicious login event from the authentication logs.**
        2.  **Search the network traffic logs for connections originating from the IP address associated with the login event around the same time.**
        3.  **Search the endpoint logs on the host associated with the login event for any process executions or file modifications that occurred shortly after the login.**

    *   **Tools:** SIEMs are specifically designed for data aggregation and correlation.

*   **Key Takeaways:**
    *   Identify the different data sources that are relevant to your investigation.
    *   Correlate events based on common fields (e.g., IP address, username, timestamp).
    *   Use a SIEM or other data aggregation tool to automate the process.

**Subtopic 9: Frequency Analysis**

*   **Concept:** Determining the number of times a specific event occurs within a certain timeframe.

*   **Explanation:** It helps in identifying unusual spikes or dips in event occurrences that may indicate malicious activity. For example, a sudden increase in failed login attempts or a surge in network traffic to a specific IP address.

*   **Examples:**

    *   **Linux (Command Line):**

        ```bash
        # Count the number of SSH login attempts per minute
        cat /var/log/auth.log | grep "Accepted publickey" | awk '{print substr($1,1,16)}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
        ```

    *   **Splunk (SPL):**

        ```splunk
        # Count the number of events by type in the last 24 hours
        index=main | timechart count by eventtype
        ```

    *   **Azure Sentinel (KQL):**

        ```kql
        // Count the number of events by type over time
        SecurityEvent
        | summarize count() by EventID, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
        | render timechart
        ```

*   **Key Takeaways:**
    *   Useful for identifying sudden spikes or dips in event occurrences.
    *   Can be combined with other analysis techniques for more accurate threat detection.

**Subtopic 10: Distribution Analysis**

*   **Concept:** Analyzing how data is distributed to identify outliers or anomalies.

*   **Explanation:** It is based on the principle that normal data follows a predictable distribution. By analyzing the distribution, you can identify data points that deviate significantly from the norm, which may indicate malicious activity.

*   **Examples:**

    *   **Splunk (SPL):**

        ```splunk
        # Analyze the distribution of request sizes in web server logs
        index=web sourcetype=access_combined | stats count, min(bytes), max(bytes), avg(bytes), stdev(bytes) by clientip
        ```

    *   **Azure Sentinel (KQL):**

        ```kql
        // Analyze the distribution of bytes transferred
        NetworkTraffic
        | summarize count(), min(Bytes), max(Bytes), avg(Bytes), stdev(Bytes)
        ```

*   **Key Takeaways:**
    *   Helps in identifying data points that deviate significantly from the norm.
    *   Useful for detecting anomalies in network traffic, user behavior, and system activity.

**Module Project/Exercise:**

**Data Analysis Challenge:**

You are given a sample dataset of web server logs. Your task is to use the data analysis techniques you've learned in this module to identify any suspicious activity.

Okay, let's dive deep into Module 7: Building Threat Hunting Scenarios and Hypotheses. This is where the rubber meets the road, turning theoretical knowledge into actionable hunting strategies. We'll explore how to leverage threat intelligence, analyze internal data, and formulate testable hypotheses to uncover hidden threats.

**Module 7: Building Threat Hunting Scenarios and Hypotheses**

*   **Module Objective:** Learn to develop and test threat hunting scenarios based on threat intelligence and internal data.

**7.1 Understanding Threat Actors and Their TTPs**

*   **Objective:** Identify and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by various threat actors.

    *   **What are TTPs?**  TTPs describe *how* an adversary operates. They provide a detailed picture of their methods, tools, and behaviors. Think of it this way:

        *   **Tactics:**  The high-level strategic goal (e.g., "Initial Access," "Privilege Escalation").  Mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
        *   **Techniques:**  The specific method used to achieve a tactic (e.g., "Spearphishing Attachment," "Exploitation for Privilege Escalation"). Also mapped to MITRE ATT&CK.
        *   **Procedures:** The *specific* steps taken to execute a technique.  This is where you get into the nitty-gritty details that are unique to a particular threat actor or campaign.

    *   **Why are TTPs important for Threat Hunting?**  TTPs are *more durable* than Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) like IP addresses or file hashes.  Threat actors frequently change their infrastructure, but their underlying TTPs often remain consistent.  By focusing on TTPs, you can detect and respond to threats even when the specific IoCs are unknown or have been changed.

    *   **Leveraging the MITRE ATT&CK Framework:** The MITRE ATT&CK framework is a knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.  It provides a common language for describing adversary behavior and helps you understand how different techniques fit together in an attack chain.

        *   **Accessing the MITRE ATT&CK Framework:**
            *   Online:  Go to [https://attack.mitre.org/](https://attack.mitre.org/)
            *   Downloadable:  MITRE provides downloadable versions of the framework in various formats (e.g., JSON, Excel).

        *   **Using ATT&CK for Threat Hunting:**
            1.  **Identify Relevant Threat Actors:**  Based on your organization's threat model, identify the threat actors most likely to target your organization.
            2.  **Research Their TTPs:**  Use the MITRE ATT&CK framework to research the TTPs used by these threat actors.
            3.  **Map TTPs to Your Environment:**  Identify which TTPs are relevant to your environment and which data sources you can use to detect them.
            4.  **Develop Threat Hunting Scenarios:**  Create scenarios based on the TTPs that you want to detect.

    *   **Example:**  Let's say you're concerned about APT29 (Cozy Bear), a Russian-linked threat actor known for targeting government and critical infrastructure.

        1.  **Identify Relevant Threat Actor:** APT29.
        2.  **Research Their TTPs:**  Using the MITRE ATT&CK framework, we find that APT29 uses techniques like:
            *   Spearphishing Attachment (T1566.001)
            *   Credential Dumping (T1003)
            *   Lateral Movement (T1021)
        3.  **Map TTPs to Your Environment:**  We can use email logs to detect spearphishing attachments, endpoint logs to detect credential dumping, and network logs to detect lateral movement.
        4.  **Develop Threat Hunting Scenarios:**  We can create scenarios to look for suspicious email attachments, unusual process activity on endpoints, and unusual network connections.

    *   **Practical Exercise:**  Choose a known threat actor (e.g., APT41, Lazarus Group, FIN7) and research their TTPs using the MITRE ATT&CK framework.  Identify at least three TTPs and explain how you could detect them in your environment.

**7.2 Developing Threat Hunting Hypotheses**

*   **Objective:** Formulate testable hypotheses based on threat intelligence and internal data.

    *   **What is a Threat Hunting Hypothesis?**  A threat hunting hypothesis is an educated guess about where malicious activity might be occurring in your environment.  It's a statement that you can test using data analysis.

    *   **Characteristics of a Good Hypothesis:**

        *   **Testable:**  You should be able to test the hypothesis using available data.
        *   **Specific:**  The hypothesis should be specific enough to guide your investigation.
        *   **Relevant:**  The hypothesis should be relevant to your organization's threat model.

    *   **Sources for Developing Hypotheses:**

        *   **Threat Intelligence:**  Threat intelligence feeds, reports, and advisories can provide valuable information about emerging threats, attacker TTPs, and vulnerable systems.
        *   **Internal Data:**  Your own security logs, network traffic data, and endpoint data can reveal suspicious activity and potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Vulnerability Assessments:**  Vulnerability assessments can identify weaknesses in your systems that attackers could exploit.
        *   **Incident Response Reports:**  Past incident response reports can provide insights into how attackers have targeted your organization in the past.

    *   **Types of Hypotheses:**

        *   **Intelligence-Driven Hypotheses:**  Based on threat intelligence reports or advisories.  Example:  "We believe that APT29 is targeting our organization using spearphishing attachments.  We will look for suspicious email attachments with specific file types or subject lines."
        *   **Anomaly-Driven Hypotheses:**  Based on unusual patterns or anomalies in your data.  Example:  "We have noticed a spike in outbound network traffic to a specific country.  We will investigate the source and destination of this traffic to determine if it is malicious."
        *   **Vulnerability-Driven Hypotheses:**  Based on known vulnerabilities in your systems.  Example:  "We have a vulnerable web server that is susceptible to SQL injection attacks.  We will look for evidence of SQL injection attempts in our web server logs."
        *   **Behavior-Driven Hypotheses:** Based on known malicious behaviors. Example: "We will look for PowerShell scripts downloading and executing code from the internet"

    *   **Formulating a Hypothesis:**  A good hypothesis typically follows this structure:

        *   **IF** (condition):  Describe the condition you are looking for.
        *   **THEN** (expected outcome):  Describe the expected outcome if the condition is true.
        *   **BECAUSE** (rationale):  Explain why you expect this outcome based on threat intelligence or internal data.

    *   **Example:**

        *   **IF** we see a user account logging in from multiple geographically distant locations within a short period of time,
        *   **THEN** it may indicate a compromised account,
        *   **BECAUSE** attackers often use compromised accounts to gain access to internal systems.

    *   **Practical Exercise:**  Based on the threat actor you researched in the previous exercise, develop at least three threat hunting hypotheses.  For each hypothesis, explain the condition, expected outcome, and rationale.

**7.3 Testing Hypotheses**

*   **Objective:**  Use data analysis techniques to validate or reject threat hunting hypotheses.

    *   **Data Sources:**  The data sources you need to test your hypotheses will depend on the specific hypothesis and the TTPs you are investigating.  Common data sources include:

        *   **Security Logs:**  Windows Event Logs, Linux Syslog, firewall logs, web server logs, etc.
        *   **Network Traffic Data:**  PCAP files, NetFlow data, Zeek logs.
        *   **Endpoint Data:**  Process activity, file system changes, registry modifications.
        *   **Threat Intelligence Feeds:**  IoCs, TTPs, and other threat intelligence data.

    *   **Data Analysis Techniques:**  You will need to use a variety of data analysis techniques to test your hypotheses.  Some common techniques include:

        *   **Searching and Filtering:**  Using search operators and filters to identify specific events or patterns in your data.
        *   **Aggregation and Grouping:**  Grouping data by specific attributes to identify trends and anomalies.
        *   **Correlation:**  Combining data from multiple sources to identify relationships between events.
        *   **Visualization:**  Using charts and graphs to visualize data and identify patterns.
        *   **Statistical Analysis:**  Using statistical methods to identify outliers and anomalies.

    *   **Tools for Testing Hypotheses:**  There are many tools available for testing threat hunting hypotheses.  Some popular tools include:

        *   **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) Systems:**  Splunk, QRadar, Sentinel.
        *   **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Solutions:**  CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Carbon Black.
        *   **Network Traffic Analysis (NTA) Tools:**  Wireshark, Zeek, Suricata.
        *   **Log Analysis Tools:**  Graylog, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
        *   **Scripting Languages:**  Python, PowerShell.

    *   **Example (Testing the Compromised Account Hypothesis):**

        1.  **Hypothesis:**  IF we see a user account logging in from multiple geographically distant locations within a short period of time, THEN it may indicate a compromised account, BECAUSE attackers often use compromised accounts to gain access to internal systems.
        2.  **Data Source:**  Security logs (e.g., Windows Event Logs, authentication logs).
        3.  **Tools:**  SIEM (e.g., Splunk, Sentinel) or scripting language (e.g., Python).
        4.  **Analysis Steps (using Splunk):**

            ```splunk
            index=security sourcetype=WinEventLog EventCode=4624  // Windows Event ID for successful login
            | stats count by Account_Name, src_ip
            | search count > 1
            | iplocation src_ip   //  Get geolocation information for the source IP addresses
            | stats values(City), values(Country) by Account_Name
            | search count > 1  // Filter for accounts with logins from multiple locations
            ```

        5.  **Interpretation:**  If the query returns accounts that have logged in from multiple geographically distant locations, it supports the hypothesis that the account may be compromised.  Further investigation is needed to confirm the compromise.

    *   **Example (Testing the PowerShell Download Hypothesis):**

        1. **Hypothesis:** IF we see powershell executing a command that downloads code from an external source, THEN it may indicate a malicious PowerShell script, BECAUSE attackers often use PowerShell to download and execute malicious code.
        2. **Data Source:** Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) logs, Sysmon logs
        3. **Tools:** EDR Solution, SIEM
        4. **Analysis Steps (using Sysmon and PowerShell - this would be done on the endpoint during the hunt):**

        First, ensure Sysmon is configured to log PowerShell events (Event ID 7, 8, 4103, 4104). A sample Sysmon configuration might look like this:

        ```xml
        <Sysmon schemaversion="4.82">
          <EventFiltering>
            <RuleGroup name="" groupRelation="or">
              <PowerShell EventID="1">
                <ScriptBlockText condition="contains">Invoke-WebRequest</ScriptBlockText>
              </PowerShell>
              <PowerShell EventID="1">
                <ScriptBlockText condition="contains">WebClient.DownloadString</ScriptBlockText>
              </PowerShell>
            </RuleGroup>
          </EventFiltering>
        </Sysmon>
        ```

        Now, query the Event Logs for the relevant events:

        ```powershell
        Get-WinEvent -Logname "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" |
        Where-Object {$_.ID -in (1)} | # PowerShell Script Block
        ForEach-Object {
            $eventData = $_.Properties | ForEach-Object {$_.Value}
            if ($eventData -like "*Invoke-WebRequest*" -or $eventData -like "*WebClient.DownloadString*") {
                Write-Host "Possible malicious script block found in event ID $($_.ID) from $($_.TimeCreated):"
                Write-Host $eventData
            }
        }
        ```

        This PowerShell script looks through the Sysmon logs for Event ID 1 (PowerShell script block).  It filters the logs for instances where the script contains `Invoke-WebRequest` or `WebClient.DownloadString`.

    *   **Interpreting Results:**  Based on the results of your data analysis, you can either:

        *   **Validate the Hypothesis:**  If you find evidence that supports the hypothesis, you can conclude that malicious activity is likely occurring.
        *   **Reject the Hypothesis:**  If you do not find evidence that supports the hypothesis, you can reject it and move on to a different hypothesis.
        *   **Refine the Hypothesis:**  If you find some evidence that supports the hypothesis, but it is not conclusive, you can refine the hypothesis and try again.

    *   **Practical Exercise:**  Choose one of the hypotheses you developed in the previous exercise and use data analysis techniques to test it.  Document your data sources, tools, analysis steps, and results.

**7.4 Documenting Threat Hunting Scenarios**

*   **Objective:**  Create clear and concise documentation for your threat hunting scenarios.

    *   **Why Documentation is Important:**  Documentation is essential for:

        *   **Knowledge Sharing:**  Sharing your knowledge with other members of your security team.
        *   **Reproducibility:**  Allowing you to repeat the threat hunt in the future.
        *   **Training:**  Training new members of your security team.
        *   **Continuous Improvement:**  Identifying areas for improvement in your threat hunting process.

        *   **References:**  Links to relevant threat intelligence reports, advisories, and other resources.
        *   **Version History:**  A record of changes made to the document over time.

    *   **Example:**

        **Title:**  Detecting Spearphishing Attachments from APT29

        **Description:**  This scenario is designed to detect spearphishing attachments from APT29, a Russian-linked threat actor.

        **Threat Actor:**  APT29 (Cozy Bear)

        **TTPs:**

            *   Spearphishing Attachment (T1566.001)

        **Hypothesis:**

            *   IF we see an email with a malicious attachment from an external sender,
            *   THEN it may indicate a spearphishing attempt from APT29,
            *   BECAUSE APT29 is known to use spearphishing attachments to gain initial access to victim networks.

        **Data Sources:**

            *   Email logs
            *   Endpoint logs

        **Tools:**

            *   SIEM (e.g., Splunk, Sentinel)
            *   Sandboxing tool (e.g., VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis)

        **Analysis Steps:**

            1.  Search email logs for emails with attachments from external senders.
            2.  Filter for attachments with suspicious file types (e.g., .exe, .scr, .docm).
            3.  Analyze the attachments in a sandboxing tool to determine if they are malicious.
            4.  If the attachment is malicious, investigate the sender and recipient to determine the scope of the attack.

        **Expected Results:**

            *   Malicious attachments from external senders.
            *   Suspicious email subject lines or body content.
            *   Evidence of the attachment being executed on the recipient's endpoint.

        **False Positive Considerations:**

            *   Legitimate emails with attachments from external senders.
            *   Attachments that are flagged as malicious but are actually false positives.

        **Remediation Steps:**

            *   Quarantine the malicious email.
            *   Block the sender's email address.
            *   Scan the recipient's endpoint for malware.
            *   Alert the recipient to the potential spearphishing attempt.

**7.5 Creating Threat Hunting Playbooks**

*   **Objective:**  Document the steps to take when a threat is detected.

    *   **What is a Threat Hunting Playbook?**  A threat hunting playbook is a step-by-step guide that outlines the actions to take when a threat is detected during a threat hunt.  It provides a consistent and repeatable process for responding to threats.

    *   **Elements of a Threat Hunting Playbook:**

        *   **Scenario:**  The threat hunting scenario that the playbook applies to.
        *   **Trigger:**  The event that triggers the playbook (e.g., detection of a malicious attachment).
        *   **Initial Response:**  The first steps to take when the trigger event occurs (e.g., quarantine the email, alert the security team).
        *   **Investigation:**  The steps to take to investigate the incident and determine the scope of the attack (e.g., analyze the email header, scan the recipient's endpoint).
        *   **Containment:**  The steps to take to contain the incident and prevent further damage (e.g., block the attacker's IP address, disable the compromised account).
        *   **Eradication:**  The steps to take to remove the threat from the environment (e.g., remove malware from infected systems, reset passwords).
        *   **Recovery:**  The steps to take to restore systems to their normal state (e.g., restore data from backups, re-enable disabled accounts).
        *   **Lessons Learned:**  The lessons learned from the incident and how to improve the threat hunting process.

    *   **Example (Playbook for Spearphishing Attachment):**

        **Scenario:**  Detecting Spearphishing Attachments from APT29

        **Trigger:**  Detection of a malicious attachment in an email.

        **Initial Response:**

            1.  Quarantine the malicious email.
            2.  Alert the security team.
            3.  Notify the recipient of the potential spearphishing attempt.

        **Investigation:**

            1.  Analyze the email header to identify the sender's IP address and other information.
            2.  Scan the recipient's endpoint for malware.
            3.  Analyze the attachment in a sandboxing tool to determine its behavior.
            4.  Review security logs for other suspicious activity associated with the sender or recipient.

        **Containment:**

            1.  Block the sender's email address.
            2.  Disable any compromised accounts.

        **Recovery:**

            1.  Restore data from backups if necessary.
            2.  Re-enable disabled accounts.
            3.  Monitor systems for any further suspicious activity.

        **Lessons Learned:**

            1.  Review the effectiveness of existing email security controls.
            2.  Provide additional training to employees on how to identify and avoid spearphishing attacks.
            3.  Improve the threat hunting process based on the lessons learned from the incident.

    *   **Practical Exercise:**  Create a threat hunting playbook for the threat hunting scenario that you documented in the previous exercise.

**7.6 Real-World Threat Hunting Scenarios and Case Studies**

*   **Objective:**  Explore examples of common threat hunting scenarios and case studies of successful threat hunts.

    *   **Common Threat Hunting Scenarios:**

        *   **Compromised Accounts:**  Detecting compromised accounts based on unusual login activity, suspicious behavior, or data exfiltration.
        *   **Lateral Movement:**  Detecting lateral movement by attackers within the network.
        *   **Data Exfiltration:**  Detecting data exfiltration by attackers.
        *   **Malware Infections:**  Detecting malware infections based on suspicious process activity, file system changes, or network traffic.
        *   **Insider Threats:**  Detecting insider threats based on unusual user behavior or access to sensitive data.
        *   **Ransomware Activity:**  Detecting early stages of ransomware attacks.

    *   **Case Studies:**

        *   **The Target Breach (2013):**  Attackers gained access to Target's network through a third-party vendor and used a point-of-sale (POS) malware to steal credit card data from millions of customers.  A proactive threat hunt could have potentially detected the malware before it caused significant damage.
        *   **The Equifax Breach (2017):**  Attackers exploited a known vulnerability in Equifax's Apache Struts web server to gain access to sensitive data on millions of consumers.  A proactive vulnerability assessment and threat hunt could have prevented the breach.
        *   **The SolarWinds Supply Chain Attack (2020):**  Attackers compromised SolarWinds' Orion software and used it to distribute malware to thousands of organizations.  This attack highlights the importance of supply chain security and the need for proactive threat hunting to detect sophisticated attacks.

    *   **Learning from Case Studies:**  By studying real-world case studies, you can learn about the TTPs used by attackers, the vulnerabilities they exploit, and the mistakes that organizations make that allow them to be compromised.  You can then use this knowledge to improve your own threat hunting process and prevent similar attacks from happening to your organization.

Congratulations! You've reached the final module. This is where you put everything you've learned into practice. The goal here isn't just to *understand* threat hunting, but to *demonstrate* that understanding by building something tangible.  Think of this as not just a project, but a portfolio piece – something you can show off to potential employers or use to further your career. This module also will focus on the best parts of teaching, so that you too will have the skills to teach others about the topic.

**Project Options:**

Before we dive into the steps, let's clarify the project options. You can choose *one* of the following:

1.  **Threat Hunting Dashboard:**  A web-based dashboard visualizing key security metrics and potential threats, pulling data from various sources (logs, threat intelligence feeds, etc.).
2.  **Threat Hunting Playbook Automation:** A script (e.g., Python) that automates steps in a specific threat hunting playbook (e.g., detecting lateral movement).
3.  **Threat Hunting Tool:**  A command-line or GUI tool that performs a specific threat hunting task (e.g., a tool to identify DNS tunneling).
4.  **Threat Hunting Report & Presentation:** A detailed report analyzing a specific real-world threat (e.g., a recent ransomware campaign) and presenting your findings, including indicators of compromise (IoCs) and mitigation strategies. This can be a great option if coding isn't your strongest suit, but you excel at analysis and communication.
5.  **Cyber Threat Hunting 101 Teaching Assistant:** A teaching assistant module that would include creating quizzes, grading them, creating new content for the course, or answering student questions.

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

**Phase 1: Planning (Weeks 1-2)**

1.  **Project Selection (Day 1):**
    *   **Action:** Carefully review the project options above.
    *   **Considerations:**
        *   Your existing skillset: What are you already good at?
        *   Your interests: What are you most excited to learn?
        *   Time commitment: Which project can you realistically complete in the allotted time?
    *   **Deliverable:** A one-paragraph description of your chosen project and why you chose it.

2.  **Scope Definition (Day 2-3):**
    *   **Action:** Define the *specific* scope of your project.  Be realistic. It's better to do a small thing well than a big thing poorly.
    *   **Example (Threat Hunting Dashboard):** "My dashboard will visualize failed login attempts, suspicious process executions (based on Sysmon logs), and connections to known malicious IP addresses (using a VirusTotal API integration). It will pull data from Windows Event Logs and Sysmon logs, stored in an Elasticsearch instance."
    *   **Example (Threat Hunting Playbook Automation):** "I will automate the playbook for detecting PowerShell-based attacks, specifically those using obfuscation techniques. The script will parse Sysmon logs, identify PowerShell processes with suspicious command-line arguments (e.g., encoded commands), and generate alerts."
    *   **Example (Threat Hunting Tool):** "My tool will analyze DNS traffic (from a PCAP file) and identify potential DNS tunneling attempts by looking for unusually long domain names and high query frequencies to specific domains."
    *   **Example (Threat Hunting Report & Presentation):** "I will analyze the recent 'LockBit 3.0' ransomware campaign, focusing on their initial access vectors, encryption methods, and extortion tactics. My report will include IoCs and recommendations for preventing LockBit infections."
    *   **Example (Cyber Threat Hunting 101 Teaching Assistant):** "I will create a new quiz for module 1, grade the quiz, and answer the top 5 most asked questions from the students."
    *   **Deliverable:** A detailed project scope document (1-2 pages) outlining the specific features, data sources, and functionality of your project.

3.  **Technology Stack Selection (Day 4-5):**

*   **Ask for Help:** Don't be afraid to ask for help when you're stuck.

This module is designed to be challenging, but also rewarding. By the end of this course, you'll have a tangible project that demonstrates your skills and knowledge in cyber threat hunting. Good luck! Let me know if you have any questions. This is an iterative process, so don't be afraid to experiment, learn, and adapt as you go along. Remember, the journey is just as important as the destination.

This detailed breakdown provides a solid foundation for Module 8. I've tried to incorporate my teaching style by providing clear instructions, practical examples, and encouragement.  Remember, the goal is not just to complete the project, but to *learn* and *grow* as a threat hunter.
