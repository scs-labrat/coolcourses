Okay, here's a hyper-detailed, step-by-step deep dive into Module 8, "Capstone Project: Building Your Own Cyber Threat Hunting 101," based on the course outline. I'll aim to make this practical, engaging, and reflective of my teaching style, emphasizing open sharing and understanding.

**Module 8: Capstone Project: Building Your Own Cyber Threat Hunting 101**

**Module Objective:** Integrate all learned knowledge and skills to create a functional clone of the course topic.

**Introduction:**

Congratulations! You've reached the final module. This is where you put everything you've learned into practice. The goal here isn't just to *understand* threat hunting, but to *demonstrate* that understanding by building something tangible.  Think of this as not just a project, but a portfolio piece â€“ something you can show off to potential employers or use to further your career. This module also will focus on the best parts of teaching, so that you too will have the skills to teach others about the topic.

**Project Options:**

Before we dive into the steps, let's clarify the project options. You can choose *one* of the following:

1.  **Threat Hunting Dashboard:**  A web-based dashboard visualizing key security metrics and potential threats, pulling data from various sources (logs, threat intelligence feeds, etc.).
2.  **Threat Hunting Playbook Automation:** A script (e.g., Python) that automates steps in a specific threat hunting playbook (e.g., detecting lateral movement).
3.  **Threat Hunting Tool:**  A command-line or GUI tool that performs a specific threat hunting task (e.g., a tool to identify DNS tunneling).
4.  **Threat Hunting Report & Presentation:** A detailed report analyzing a specific real-world threat (e.g., a recent ransomware campaign) and presenting your findings, including indicators of compromise (IoCs) and mitigation strategies. This can be a great option if coding isn't your strongest suit, but you excel at analysis and communication.
5.  **Cyber Threat Hunting 101 Teaching Assistant:** A teaching assistant module that would include creating quizzes, grading them, creating new content for the course, or answering student questions.

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

**Phase 1: Planning (Weeks 1-2)**

    *   **Action:** Carefully review the project options above.
    *   **Considerations:**
        *   Your existing skillset: What are you already good at?
        *   Your interests: What are you most excited to learn?
        *   Time commitment: Which project can you realistically complete in the allotted time?
    *   **Deliverable:** A one-paragraph description of your chosen project and why you chose it.

2.  **Scope Definition (Day 2-3):**
    *   **Action:** Define the *specific* scope of your project.  Be realistic. It's better to do a small thing well than a big thing poorly.
    *   **Example (Threat Hunting Dashboard):** "My dashboard will visualize failed login attempts, suspicious process executions (based on Sysmon logs), and connections to known malicious IP addresses (using a VirusTotal API integration). It will pull data from Windows Event Logs and Sysmon logs, stored in an Elasticsearch instance."
    *   **Example (Threat Hunting Playbook Automation):** "I will automate the playbook for detecting PowerShell-based attacks, specifically those using obfuscation techniques. The script will parse Sysmon logs, identify PowerShell processes with suspicious command-line arguments (e.g., encoded commands), and generate alerts."
    *   **Example (Threat Hunting Tool):** "My tool will analyze DNS traffic (from a PCAP file) and identify potential DNS tunneling attempts by looking for unusually long domain names and high query frequencies to specific domains."
    *   **Example (Threat Hunting Report & Presentation):** "I will analyze the recent 'LockBit 3.0' ransomware campaign, focusing on their initial access vectors, encryption methods, and extortion tactics. My report will include IoCs and recommendations for preventing LockBit infections."
    *   **Example (Cyber Threat Hunting 101 Teaching Assistant):** "I will create a new quiz for module 1, grade the quiz, and answer the top 5 most asked questions from the students."
